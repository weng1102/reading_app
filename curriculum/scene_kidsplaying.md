This scene narrative allow me to practice describing complex illustrated scene. The scene is decomposed into simpler subscenes. These subscenes are identified by overlays with corresponding subscene labels. These subscenes serve as the bases for sentence fill-in and reading exercises that promote sentence formation.
## Sentence Formation Practice
### Subscene Narratives with Fill-ins (labeled)
The subscene narrative fill-ins lets me practice forming sentences that describe a single illustration. The illustration has overlays of numbered headings that correspond to the subscene descriptions to afford me more structure, if necessary.
