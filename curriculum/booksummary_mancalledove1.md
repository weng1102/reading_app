She felt that he was a man that valued justice and hardwork and people like him weren't made anymore. She thought, "no boy had gone the wrong way on a train just because he liked sitting next to her while she spoke."
We are also introduced to Sonja's father. He seems to be a grumpy man like Ove who is set in his ways.

## Chapter 17-18
### Summary
The weather was ice cold and snowy. Ove noticed a hole in the snowdrift where the cat had been hiding. Parvaneh appeared and insisted they help the cat from freezing to death. With a swiftness the cat was in her arms, as she moved towards Ove's home. Against Ove's better judgement, he assisted in helping the cat. As Ove was heading upstairs to retrieve some blankets, he noticed he was out of breath, with a pain in his chest. However he won't be needing his heart much longer, he thought.
Parvaneh quickly left the living room and entered the kitchen. As she looked around she noticed Ove's wife's belongings are still present. Post-it notes on the fridge, hair clips on the table, and her decorations in the window. Along the floor were soft wheel marks. She also noticed the stove and kitchen counter are much lower than usual. Ove had rebuilt the kitchen after Sonja's accident.

While in Spain, Sonja and Ove boarded a bus for an adventure of a lifetime. Or so they thought. As Ove passed the driver Ove noticed he smelled of wine and concluded that's how things were in Spain. It was during that trip they were in a horrible accident that would take the life of their sweet unborn child and cause serious injuries to Sonja. The bus veered into the crash barrier, causing the cars behind the bus to slam into it like a domino effect.
As Sonja laid in the hospital bed, Ove stayed by her side. Even throwing the doctor through the door when he told Ove thast Sonja may never wake up. She would eventually recover enough to go back to Sweden and decided she would go to therapy in order to deal with the darkness that consumed her. Sonja was determined
not to allow her pain to define her life.
Over the next few months Ove would meet the men in white shirts, as we discussed in previous chapters. They would instruct Ove on what paperwork needed to be filled out, but did not provide him with information on how they planned on helping Sonja get better. Instead, it they determined Sonja would be placed in a
home where others like her lived. This angered Ove so he rebuilt areas of their home so they would be accessible for Sonja. He installed a lower countertop, fitted ramps over the thresholds, and reconstructed door frames.

### Summary
Ove explains that doctors had prescribed a number of painkillers for Sonja near the end of her life, which he happens to have stored away. It had quickly occurred to Ove that taking the medication was a convenient way to kill himself. However, Ove begins to hear the cat yelling outside. As he begins to arrange the pills along the edge of the sink, he notices that the cat is crying even louder now.
Despite, his efforts to ignore the sound of the cat, Ove puts the pills back inside. As he passes the window, he sees Anders girlfriend "Blond Weed" rush towards the cat. Ove opens his front door just as she's about to kick the cat. Ove says nothing and looks dangerously angry as he calls the cat to come inside. When Ove picks up the pill bottle up once again, the cat looks at him with a horrified expression. Ove puts the bottle away and drinks his coffee while the cat drinks water. They head back outside and Ove thinks that maybe he can wait an hour to die.
As Ove opens the door to retrieve the mail, he comes across a youth who is wearing a postman's uniform. Ove asks the youth what he wants and notices that it's the same youth who was trying to fix the lady's bike the other day. The youth hands Ove his mail and explains that he's bringing him the mail, since the mailbox is smashed. The youth doesn't leave and finally asks Ove if his wife's name is Sonja. He continues, saying that he noticed Ove's last name and had a teacher with the same name. The youth starts a question, but then turns to leave.

## Chapter 27-28
### Summary
We learn that the reason that Ove and Rune had a falling out was over their cars. Sonja described it as Ove being loyal to a Saab and Rune being loyal to a Volvo and their commitment to changing models over the years. However, it's also revealed that it was a little more complicated than that. Their change in cars was due to changing life circumstances and their feelings over those changes.
Ove follows through with his commitment to teach Parvaneh to drive but to her surprise he teaches her on a manual transmission. It is quite an intense experience in the car with both Parvaneh and Ove yelling at each other. In one instance Parvaneh accidently put the car into reverse instead of drive and is very close to hitting another car. As Parvaneh is expressing her stress over the situation she confesses to Ove that she is pregnant. Ove responds by getting out of the car and confronting a driver in another car who had just honked at them. After the confrontation Ove gets back into the car and more kindly and patiently teaches Parvaneh how to drive.
In Chapter 28 we learn more details about Rune and Ove's relationship. We learn that there was a rivalry over the cars but it was also connected to stages of life they were going through. Rune upgraded his car to fit a stroller for his baby while Ove upgraded his car to fit a wheelchair for Sonja. Later Ove bought a hatchback to accommodate Sonja's more modern wheelchair while Rune bought a station wagon hoping to grow his family. However Rune and Alice were not able to have more children and when their only son left home Rune got a sporty BMW. This angered Ove especially because Rune had a strained relationship with his son. We learn that his difficult relationship with his son might be the thing that Ove was never able to forgive Rune over.
### Discussion
* Ove is a loyal Saab driver and Rune a loyal Volvo driver. Do you have a type of car that you are loyal to? What is your dream car?
  * Parvaneh was surprised to learn that Ove was teaching her to drive on a manual transmission. Do you think this was the best way for him to teach Parvaneh to drive? How would you have handled it?

  * What do you think about his reaction-how he got out of the car and confronted another driver, but then continued to teach Parvaneh and even complimented her by saying "You are not a complete twit."
* As we learn about Ove and Rune's relationship we learn there are a lot of complexities to it that are simplified by their loyalty to their cars. What elements of their relationship stood out to you?

## Chapter 29-30
### Summary
After Ove's driving lesson with Parvaneh, they took a detour to a little cafe. There they met Adrian, the young man who wanted to fix up the bike for the girl he wants to be his girlfriend. Ove has a tough shell, but has a heart for love. As Adrian is unhooking the bike from the back of the Saab, Adrian shares with Ove that his father has been in jail. Ove takes it upon himself to jump in and show Adrian how to repair the bike's tire. As the group returns back to the cafe they find Amel, the cafe's owner, attempting to fix a fan heater. Ove steps in to help out, so Amel will allow the cat to stay. 

In chapter 30 we learn that Sonja was diagnosed with cancer. Her students loved her dearly and would take turns visiting her. However change was always difficult for Ove. Sonja called him "the most inflexible man in the world". After Sonja passed away, Ove had a difficult time. The days and weeks floated together. It wasn't until he met Parvaneh and Patrick when he backed into Ove's mailbox. His world changed that day.
At the end of chapter 30, Parvaneh and Ove drive off from visiting Sonja's grave. Parvaneh suggests helping Ove clear out some of Sonja's belongings from the house. But Ove would not have any part in such a discussion.

On her way in, Parvaneh handed Ove her phone and told him it was Lena, the journalist. Lena asked Ove if he had read the newspaper she sent. As Ove goes to find the newspaper he notices the angry man in the white shirt again. Specifically, he realizes that the man in the white shirt is driving his Skoda through the residential area.
Ove drops the phone and runs to yell at him.

### Summary
Ove wakes up to a smell he hasn't experienced since Sonja died. Mirsad is in the house and he has made toast and coffee and fed the cat tuna. Ove lets Mirsad know that he is taking the cat for their morning walk and Mirsad offers to go with them. As they are walking the neighbor, Jimmy, comes out and greets them. He lets Ove know he is starting to exercise so asks if he can join the walk as well.
As they walk, Jimmy updates Ove on the latest news about Anita and Rune. Anita has been asking the Social Workers for assistance in caring for Rune. However, they have determined that caring for Rune has become too much for Anita and are planning to remove him from the home. Qve, believes it will take years for the social workers to make these decisions and take action.

## Chapter 35-36
### Summary
Rune is at risk of being removed from the home he shares with his beloved wife. The white shirts are coming, and there’s not much Anita thinks she can do to help her husband stay in their home. That is until Ove, Parvaneh, Patrick, and the rest of the crew put a plan in place to save Rune from the white coats.
As the white shirts arrive, they are met at the door by Anita. Little did they know, Parvaneh, Patrick, Jimmy, Anders, Adrian, Mirsad, and Ove were also inside waiting for them. They all proclaimed they would help take care of Rune. This catches the white shirt by surprise, but the biggest surprise is when Lena, the news reporter, also appears and would like to ask them some questions.
Lena reaches into her bag and produces a pile of papers. Evidence that shows the white shirts taking people like Rune against their will, and not following the rules and procedures required. Bank statements from the last 7 years, travel arrangements, and email correspondence also prove their point. Enough evidence was given to send the white shirts away from taking Rune, and hopefully for good.
In Chapter 36 we learn just how much time Ove has dedicated to spending time with Parvaneh and her family, from reading bedtime stories with the three year old, to designing cities with the 7 year old on her computer. His true character stands out.
"It is difficult to admit that one is wrong. Particularly when one has been wrong for a very long time."

## Chapter 37-39
### Summary
Ove received a letter from the man that he saved at the train station. In the letter the man included a photograph of the himself and his three children. Ove proceeded to hang up the photograph alongside a drawing that Parvaneh's kid had drawn for him. Ove begins to use these photographs to remind himself that community is and can be a positive thing.
In chapter 37, Ove finally allows his new community to connect with his old one by bringing them all to Sonja's grave. After the visit, everyone decided to head back to the car, however Parvaneh decided to stay. Parvaneh felt a connection with Sonja, as she had now come to understand the person she was and the impact she had in Ove's life. Parvaneh then host dinner at her house and before Ove can head out, Parvaneh's daughter invites Ove to her birthday party and request an iPad for her birthday gift.

Ove and Jimmy are in the Apply store when Ove tries to use cars to gauge the character of the sales associate. Ove believes you can't reason with a person who doesn't own a car. Jimmy then ask the sales associate to show Ove an iPad. Ove proceeds to buy the seven-year-old the iPad but is still frustrated at the fact that there is no physical keyboard. The seven year old is gifted the iPad and proceeds to hug, thank and call Ove "granddad." Ove then leaves the party and heads out for a walk with the cat.

During his walk, Ove hears someone tapping the window with a hammer to break the glass. Ove then yells at the figures and runs towards them. He hits one of them and feels a stab in his chest. He thinks they managed to hit him until he realizes the pain is coming from inside his body. He falls to the ground and the pain squeezes his chest. The burglars run away and finally, Ove hears Parvaneh. Ove ask Parvaneh to make him a promise and not let the ambulance drive in the residential area right before he lost consciousness.

Once Ove arrives at the hospital, Parvaneh makes her way into the room and crumbles as she sees Ove in the hospital bed. Parvaneh pleads with Ove not to die and he responds by telling her to calm down. The doctor walks in and informs both of them about Ove's heart problem. Parvaneh looks at him blankly and the doctor says that Ove's heart is too big. Parvaneh stares at the doctor and at Ove for a minute and then starts laughing uncontrollably. Ove rolls his eyes and the doctor looks confused. Finally, the doctor says that if Ove takes medication they can control it for months or years. Parvaneh waves her hand and states that Ove is lousy at dying.
Shortly after his return home, Ove fetches boxes from the attic, and that evening Parvaneh, Nasanin, and the seven-year-old help put Sonja's things away. After 9:00pm, as the girls sleep on Ove's couch, Parvaneh grips Ove's arm and they go back to the hospital. Parvaneh gives birth to a boy.

At the end of the book, we see that the neighborhood, and Ove, continue to change and grow: Ove begins to show photos of Parvaneh's little boy to everyone he meets. The next spring, Ove also shows Sonja the invitation for Mirsad and Jimmy's wedding. Ove is the best man and Amel holds the party at his cafe. Nearly four years pass and Parvaneh wakes up at 8:15 one morning and to seen that the snow hasn't been shoveled outside Ove's house. She runs across the street and into Ove's bedroom, where the cat is lying with its head in Ove's hand. Parvaneh sits on the bed with the cat until the ambulance comes to take Ove's body away. She tells Ove to give her love to Sonja and takes the big envelope labeled "to Parvaneh" from Ove's bedside.
