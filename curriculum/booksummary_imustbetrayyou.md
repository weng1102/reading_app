# I Must Betray You by Ruta Sepetys 
## Chapter 1
On a gray Friday in October, Cristian and his best friend Luca see a large sign in their school that reads, “New Men of Romania: Long Live Communism- the bright future of mankind.” The two continue with their day more interested in talking to their female classmates and being dismissed from school. Cristian, the narrator, discusses the strict rules of the school and the society. Cristian hints at his desire to rebel against communist rule; losing his hairbrush, his interest in poetry and philosophy, and that he studies English. Cristian thinks that he can keep all this a secret. Ending the chapter with the line- “I was an idiot. I just didn’t know it yet.” 
## Chapter 2
Cristian enters the school office and encounters an intimidating stranger, likely a member of Romania's secret police- “The Securitate Agents”. The man has a file with Cristian's photo and claims to know something about him. There is an oppressive atmosphere as shown by a portrait of the Communist leader, Ceauşescu. Cristian realizes he may be in serious trouble, and the stranger's words leave him fearful for his safety- “And I know what you’ve done.”

Cristian faces questioning by a member of the secret police who accuses him of illegal activities. He tells Cristian that he knows about the illegal stamp Cristian exchanged with an American teenager for foreign money. The secret police know that Cristian’s mom is a housekeeper for the American Diplomat’s family. Cristian denies that he was aware of the foreign money he accepted but the agent proposes a compromise. The compromise is that Cristian must spy on the American diplomat's family to avoid consequences. The agent mentions Cristian’s sick grandfather, Bunu, with cancer. He asks him to be a spy with the code name “Oscar.” In return, the police will provide medicine for his grandfather. Cristian is now a 17-year-old spy to get information about the American Diplomats. 
## Chapter 4 
Cristian begins to feel guilty. He doesn’t know how he will keep this secret from his family. He knows he could fool his parents as they are busy and constantly worried. But he knows that he can’t fool his grandfather, Bunu, or his sister, Cici. He then makes up a story about university exams. He could lie and tell his family that he had been so busy studying. Cristian then begins to worry that Bunu will figure it out. He thinks about how his grandfather would think he is a traitor.

Cristian is delighted to be walking home with her. They have a conversation about the State-controlled shop they are walking by where people are cold and huddled together while they wait for leftover food. Liliana reminisces about when Bucharest was full of trees, birds, and beautiful buildings. But now, Bucharest is cold, dark, and dim. Under the strict rule of the communists, the city is not the same as it used to be. Cristian writes in his notebook about The Aplaudacii, the followers of Ceauşescu, calling them bootlickers, butt-kissers, and fawners. The chapter ends with Liliana grabbing Cristian’s arms and crying out, “Cristian! Oh-no!”

On their walk home, the two run into Starfish, the American teenager whom Cristian often buys Western contraband from. Starfish invites the two to a “video night,” a gathering where people watch VHS tapes. Cristian accepts the invite for both of them and Starfish leaves.

The building administrators report back to the communist party, and Bunu thinks that the apartments are bugged. Because of this, everyone in Cristian’s home speaks in whispers. Cristian’s mother is particularly paranoid about people listening to them and sometimes explodes in distress. Bunu, on the other hand, refuses to whisper and ignores the communist rules, insisting on having an illegal sofa in their apartment. Cristian’s
family does their best to create private spaces for each person, with Cristian sleeping in the closet. As he continues to climb the stairs to his apartment, Cristian realizes who turned him in to the secret police.

Bunu begins to have a coughing fit, and Cristian’s mother dismisses him to go count the Kents - cigarettes that the family trades as currency. Other items in the family’s bribe inventory include soap and whiskey. Cici is a seamstress who works at a textile factory and sometimes trades her work for contraband as well.
