* Ove left an envelope for Parvaneh. The envelope has Ove’s bank information, insurance policies, other documents, and a letter to Parvaneh.
  * The letter says that Adrian gets the Saab.
  * Parvaneh, her children, and Jimmy’s little girl get Ove’s money. Ove has an account from Sonja’s father with 11,563,013 kronor (over $1 million US dollars).
* Ove also leaves instructions for a simple funeral with no people. Over 300 people come to Ove’s funeral.
* At the funeral, everyone holds candles with "Sonja’s fund" engraved on them. This is what Parvaneh used most of Ove’s money for - a charity for orphaned children.
* That evening, Parvaneh shows Ove’s house to a young couple. The woman is pregnant and loves the house. The man seems less sure.
* Parvaneh asks the man what kind of car he drives. The man replies "Saab".
