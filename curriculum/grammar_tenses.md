Verb tenses can convey what, where when and how long an action occurs. Three main verb tenses describe when an action occurs within a specific time frame: past present, future. 
## Time Frames

## Grammatical Aspects
Aspects refers to the state of action of a verb.
- Simple tenses are used for actions that occur in a specfic time frame, typically currently.
  - Example, I do. I go. I eat.
- Continuous (progressive) tenses are used to describe an ongoing action.
- Perfect tenses are used to describe a finished action.
- Perfect continuous tenses are used to describe an action that was in progress and subsequently finished.
