### Author’s Note 
1. The author Robert introduces this remarkable story. A friend told Robert about two scuba divers who recently discovered a World War II German U-boat off of New Jersey. 
1. Robert contacted the divers, John Chatterton and Richie Kohler. John and Richie liked to scuba dive for fun on the weekends. 
1. Robert met John and Richie at John’s house to hear their story. John and Richie told Robert the story over 14 hours. Their story entailed discovery, mystery, rivalries, obsession, and bravery. 
1. Robert decided to turn this story into a writing opportunity. Robert attests that everything is true and accurate. Robert spent endless hours conducting research and interviews. 
1. John and Richie commented about the depth of shipwreck diving. At these depths, sometimes all the divers can see are shadows. Robert decided to call the book Shadow Divers.
### Summary
1. The book starts out in September 1991 in New Jersey. Bill Nagle waits for a fisherman to give him information on how to find a shipwreck. Bill was 40-years-old in 1991. 
1. Bill was the captain of the "Seeker," a charter diving boat that he operated from Brielle, New Jersey. Bill built the Seeker to take divers to the most dangerous wrecks in the Atlantic Ocean. 
1. When Bill was in his 20s, he became a legend of diving shipwrecks. In the 1970s and 1980s, shipwreck diving was a new sport. The equipment had changed very little since it was invented in the 1940s. 
1. Bill was a diver who always pushed the limits. He preferred undiscovered wrecks and regularly dove below 200 feet deep. 
1. Bill had spent some time diving the popular wreck the "Andrea Doria." This is a shipwreck from 1956. Many men have died while exploring this wreck. 
1. Bill’s goal was to recover the bell of the Andrea Doria. Bill bought a dive boat (the original Seeker), recruited five divers, and successfully discovered the bell. 
1. After this, Bill decided to open a charter business. By 1991, Bill was endangering his business by excessive drinking. He spent much of his time at a bar called the Harbor Inn (aka the Horrible Inn). 
1. Since shipwrecks were common places to find fish, many wrecks were discovered by fishing boat captains. These captains kept the wreck locations secret from competitors. 
1. The fishing captains would write the coordinates of the sites in a private journal. Shipwreck divers would also keep the location of wrecks a secret. 
1. Occasionally, divers and fishermen would trade numbers. This is what Bill was waiting to do at the beginning of the chapter. 
1. Bill met a fishing captain named Skeets at the Harbor Inn. Skeets told Bill about a spot 60 miles offshore. There seemed to be a very large object over 200 feet deep here. 
1. Skeets offered to trade the coordinates for the spot in exchange for a wreck he knew Bill could locate. Skeets warned Bill that his site is in a very dangerous place with strong currents. This did not worry Bill. 
1. Bill contacted John Chatterton. Bill had met John years ago during a charter trip to the Texas Tower. A man died on this trip, and John offered to retrieve the body. Bill respected John after this. 
1. Bill asked John if he wanted to help explore the mystery wreck. Bill and John enlisted twelve more divers willing to cover expenses. 
1. On September 2nd, 1991, the divers headed toward the coordinates of the mystery wreck.

### Summary
1. Deep sea divers encounter extreme dangers. Deep sea diving is a very different sport from recreational scuba diving. Most deep sea divers come close to dying, watch another diver die, or die themselves. 
1. Deep sea divers experience nitrogen narcosis. This condition happens below 66 feet and worsens as the depth increases. 
1. Nitrogen narcosis is caused by nitrogen accumulating in the bloodstream due to high underwater pressure. Nitrogen narcosis causes impaired motor skills, reduced peripheral vision, slowed thinking processes, and hallucinations. 
1. The other major danger of deep sea diving is decompression sickness. This is also known as “the bends”. This condition occurs when a diver tries to ascend too quickly. 
1. With decompression sickness, large nitrogen bubbles press onto a diver’s tissues. This causes extreme pain, paralysis, or even death. 6. To avoid decompression sickness, a diver needs to ascend slowly. The diver should stop at predetermined depths and wait for the nitrogen to naturally release from his body. 
1. Atlantic deep sea divers reach shipwrecks by charter boats. These trips are often all-day or overnight. Keys to a successful dive include good planning and reliable diving equipment. 
1. There are many challenges to deep sea diving. One challenge includes actually getting to and from the shipwreck safely. 
1. When a charter boat arrives at a dive site, the mates drop the anchor on the shipwreck. The mates dive down to ensure the anchor is securely attached to the shipwreck. 
1. The anchor line is crucial to shipwreck diving. It provides a guide for divers to find the wreck and their way back to the charter boat. 11. If a diver loses sight of the anchor line, the undersea currents can carry him miles away. These divers are usually lost to the sea. 
1. Most times, divers descend to the shipwreck alone. There is no buddy system in deep sea diving. It can be dangerous to help a diver in trouble as he might struggle and injure another diver. 
1. It takes just a few minutes to reach a 200-foot-deep shipwreck. Once a diver reaches the wreck, he has about 25 minutes to explore. 14. Most divers stay outside of the wreck. The inside of a shipwreck is dangerous and difficult to navigate. A diver can become tangled in wires or blocked by furniture. 
1. If a diver becomes lost inside a wreck, he is in grave danger. He could run out of air and drown. 
1. There is poor visibility at a shipwreck. Silt, oil, and air bubbles make it difficult to see. This is known as “zero viz” or zero visibility. 17. In 1988, a skilled diver named Joe Drodz took a trip to the Andrea Doria wreck aboard the Seeker. Joe brought a third air tank just to be safe. 
1. Joe and two partners entered the inside of the Andrea Doria wreck. Joe became tangled in a line and panicked. He experienced worsening narcosis and thought he ran out of air. 
1. Joe’s partners tried to help him. Joe panicked so bad that one partner lost his grip on Joe. At first, this partner quickly rose to the surface without decompressing and with no anchor line in sight. He was eventually able to slow his ascent and spot the anchor line. 
1. The second partner also survived. Joe died with a full tank of air. 
1. When a diver ascends and reaches the charter boat, he must climb a ladder attached to the back of the boat. 
1. In 2000, a diver named George Place reached for the ladder in rough seas. George lost his grip on the ladder and drifted away. 
1. The captain Howard Klein took his Zodiac boat to find George. Howard’s motor died so his team placed a Mayday alert. Another fishing boat found George alive. Howard made it back safely too. This incident made Howard and his team believe in miracles
