# Miranda Adams

Miranda is the murder victim. She is a haughty, controlling character who is often mean, even to the members of this group of close friends. The group as a whole seems to accept her ways, though some of them clearly do not understand why others are so willing to do the same. For example, Miranda is often mean to Katie but Katie is critical when Miranda is mean to Emma and advises Emma not to put up with it. Looking back on their relationship as the novel comes to a close, Katie says she did not always like Miranda, though she did love her.
