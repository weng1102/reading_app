## Summary
### Prologue 
* The prologue is told from Adrienne's perspective. Adrienne is a famous psychiatrist. 
* Adrienne talks about an experiment involving a "broken" vending machine. The vending machine dispenses candy and returns the money. 
* The experiment showed that the subjects happily took the free candy and often went back for more. All subjects ignored the sign with a phone number to report any malfunctions. 
* Adrienne says everyone lies. She always knows when someone is lying. 
### Chapter 1 
* This chapter is told from Tricia's perspective in the present day. 
* Tricia and her husband Ethan are driving to an open house. They are lost in a snowstorm. 
* Trisha says her relationship with Ethan moved fast. They met at a coffee shop and got married nine months later. Trisha has a secret she has not shared with Ethan yet. 
* Ethan finds the narrow road to the house. He is amazed by the house. It is a huge, remote, and elegant estate. 
* Trisha is less impressed. She feels sick as she looks at the estate. She senses that something terrible has happened in the house. 
* Ethan's car gets stuck in the driveway, so they need to walk the rest of the way. They notice there is a light on in an upstairs window. 
### Chapter 2 
* Tricia and Ethan walk in the freezing cold to the house. They ring the doorbell but no one answers. It is clear their realtor Judy isn't there yet. 
* Ethan finds a spare key, and they go inside. The living room is huge with high ceilings. Ethan wonders why the asking price is so low. Again, Tricia thinks that something terrible has happened here. 
* The house is fully furnished. Everything is covered in dust and cobwebs. There is a large portrait of a beautiful woman above the mantle. 
* The bookshelves are overflowing with books. An entire shelf is dedicated to the book "The Anatomy of Fear" by Dr. Adrienne Hale. The author's photo is the same woman as the large portrait. 
* Ethan recalls that Adrienne was known for a pop psychology book. Adrienne's book became famous after she disappeared three years ago. 
* Adrienne is assumed to be dead. The general consensus is that Adrienne's boyfriend probably killed her. 
* Trisha and Ethan suspect that this must be Adrienne's house. Tricia notices a large footprint near one of the bookshelves. 
### Chapter 3 
* The book switches to Adrienne's perspective in the past. 
* Adrienne's literary agent, Paige, arrives at Adrienne's house. Paige drops off the proof for Adrienne's upcoming book, The Anatomy of Fear. Paige thinks some of the scenes in the book are too gruesome. 
* Paige suggests that Adrienne should install a security system or get a boyfriend. Adrienne insists she is fine.

* Now, PL cannot function. She can't sleep or keep a job. The killer was  never caught. PL worries the killer is going to come back for her. 
* Adrienne tries to convince PL she is safe now. She promises PL she will  get better.
