# Born A Crime by Trevor Noah
## Chapter 1: Run
### Summary
1. Prologue: In 1927, the King of England and the South African government passed the Immorality Act. This law made it illegal for men and women of different races to have sex. People could be put in prison for up to 5 years.
1. Background: Apartheid was a system of separating people into groups and making them hate one another. This helped rulers keep control. 
1. When apartheid started, there were 5 times as many black South Africans as white South Africans. There were many tribes with different languages. There were different groups of white people too. Different groups had different rights and privileges.
1. South Africa had two main groups: the Zulu and the Xhosa. The Zulu are known as warriors. They fought against colonial armies. The Xhosa are known as thinkers. They learned English to negotiate with white people.
1. Neither the Zulu nor the Xhosa could successfully fight colonialism. The tribes blamed each other. But the tribes had a common enemy.
1. Apartheid ended in the early 1990s. Anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela became free. Then black South Africans went to war with one another.
1. When I was 9 years old, my mother threw me out of a moving car. We were coming home from church. We went to church a lot. Many black South Africans were Christian. During my childhood, we went to a mixed race church, a white church, and a black church.
1. Mixed church was a modern megachurch. The pastor was an ex-bodybuilder. There was a band and people sang. It was like Christian karaoke.
1. White church was in a wealthy neighborhood in Johannesburg. I liked Sunday School there. I wasn’t exposed to a lot of popular culture as a child. But I knew all the Bible stories. I always won Bible quizzes at white church.
1. We went to my grandmother’s black church in a tent outside. The services were very long. People spoke “in tongues.” The pastor cast out the demons.
1. We lived in a neighborhood called Eden Park. It was a tiny suburb of Johannesburg. It took a long time to get to church.
1. One Sunday morning, our second-hand car wouldn’t start. It was a fateful day. Later, the mechanic who fixed our car married my mother and became my stepfather. He would end up torturing us and shooting my mother!
1. My mother insisted on taking minibuses (public transportation) to church. My mother was very stubborn. She said the Devil didn’t want us to go to church that day. I tried to argue with her. She said, “Sun’qhela!” That means, “Don’t undermine me!” in Xhosa. If I didn’t stop she would spank me.
1. My mom was very strict. I was very naughty. She would beat me with a belt. I would try to escape by running through the neighborhood.
1. I was five years old when Nelson Mandela was released from prison. Everyone was happy. But there was also violence, mostly between two main political groups. The Inkatha Freedom Party was mostly Zulu. The leaders of the ANC (African National Congress) were mostly Xhosa.
1. These groups did not unite when apartheid ended. Instead, they fought. Thousands of people died. There was violence in our neighborhood. Most people stayed home, but my mom was never afraid. She had faith in God.
1. The Sunday I was pushed out of a car, we went to three different churches. I was tired. It was late. The streets were empty. My mom, my baby brother, and I waited and waited for a minibus to take us home.
1. When no bus came, my mother said we should hitchhike. We got into a car. Suddenly, a minibus pulled right in front of the car. The bus driver got out. He was holding a weapon. The bus driver threatened the car owner—he wanted paying passengers. My mom intervened. We got on the bus.
1. The bus driver insulted my mom for being Xhosa and for having a mixed child. My mom yelled at him. The driver started speeding. He wouldn’t let us off the bus. My mom told me we were going to jump out of the bus.
1. My mom pushed me out of the bus. She jumped out, protecting baby Andrew. It was painful! My mom shouted, “Run!” We got away.

Born a Crime by Trevor Noah 
## Chapter 2: Born a Crime 
1. Apartheid developed over many years. The Dutch established Cape Town in  1652. The Dutch went to war with native people. Then the British took over.  The Dutch moved inland. They became Afrikaners and had their own culture. 
1. The British outlawed slavery. But in reality, slavery continued. South Africa  has a lot of gold and diamonds. Native people worked in the mines. 
1. When the British Empire fell, Afrikaners took charge. They needed to control  the large population of native people. So they developed a system of racial  oppression. Apartheid was a system that kept black people under total  control. It was a police state. There were many laws.  
1. Apartheid was similar to three American systems: forcing Native Americans  onto reservations, slavery, and segregation. In South Africa, these systems  happened all at the same time. 
1. I grew up in a mixed-race family during apartheid. My mother is black. My  father is a white Swiss/German. They committed one of the worst crimes  under apartheid: having sexual relations with someone of a different race. 
1. The mixing of races is a threat to the system of institutionalized racism. A  person of mixed race shows that races can and often want to mix. 
1. In South Africa, people of mixed race aren’t considered black. Mixed people  are a separate group. The descendants of mixed people are called “colored.”  
1. Under apartheid all people had to register their race with the government.  There were special police forces who investigated mixed race couples. 
1. My mother never thought it was a big deal to have a mixed child. She was  fearless. She was a rebel. At a time when most black women worked in  factories or as maids, she learned to type and worked as a secretary.
1. Most black people had to live in “the homelands.” In order for black people  to work for white people, they had to live near white areas. Black people lived  in townships. To leave the township, you needed a pass and an ID.  
1. My mother ran away to Johannesburg and got a secret apartment. My  father lived down the hall. He was an expat. Their neighborhood, Hillbrow,  was liberal. There were integrated restaurants and nightclubs.  
1. My mom trusted my dad. He was 46. She was 24. He was quiet and shy.  She was wild and free. She wanted to have a child with him. At first he said  no. Then he agreed. It was illegal. Nine months later, I was born a crime. 
1. The doctors wondered why I was so light skinned. My mother lied. She said  my father was from Swaziland. My real father isn’t on my birth certificate.  
1. I lived with my mom in a different flat. We visited my dad when we could. I  could only see my father inside. My mother couldn’t be seen with me either. A  light-skinned child with a black woman looked suspicious.  
1. It was illegal to be mixed (one white parent and one black parent), but it  was not illegal to be colored (two colored parents). So my mom’s colored  friend would pretend I was her child and my mom was her maid!  
1. I spent a lot of time with my mom’s family in a big township called Soweto.  Only black people were allowed. There were more police. It was violent.  
1. There were informants in the neighborhood. If the police found out I was  mixed, they might take me to an orphanage. I had to stay inside.  
1. Now I regularly meet other mixed South Africans. Many of them left the  country as children because it was so difficult to be mixed during apartheid.  
1. When I first learned that leaving was an option, I was upset. I asked my  mom why we didn’t move to Switzerland. She said, “This is my country. Why  should we leave?”

Born a Crime by Trevor Noah 
## Chapter 3: Trevor, Pray 
1. Many black South Africans became Christian. But they continued to practice  their own traditions, such as witchcraft. Today, many people visit traditional  healers instead of doctors of Western medicine.  
1. People have been arrested and put on trial for witchcraft. In the homelands,  many people get struck by lightning. If you have an argument with someone  and then they get killed by lightning, you might be accused of murder! In  court, your lawyer can’t argue that witchcraft isn’t real. You will lose.  
1. I grew up with a lot of powerful women and not many men. My father was  loving, but I could not see him much because of apartheid. The only semi regular man in my life was my mother’s father, Temperance Noah.  
1. Temperance was loud. His nickname meant “the smokin’ hot grandpa.” He  was a ladies’ man. We thought he was eccentric. He had wild mood swings. It  turns out he was bipolar. Temperance used to be a boxer. When he was 80,  he tried to box with me! 
1. We were Temperance’s first family and his heirs. He lived with his second  family. My mom worried the second family would poison her to get his money!  
1. My aunt Sibongile was strong. Her husband, Dinky, was small. He tried to  seem dominant and controlling, but he was not. When Sibongile was tired of  Dinky trying to control her, she threatened to pour boiling water on Dinky! 
1. My grandmother, Frances Noah, was the family matriarch. She took care of  the house and the children. She is calm and smart. She has a great memory. 
1. My great-grandmother Koko lived with us too. She was in her 90s. She  couldn’t see. She couldn’t walk by herself. She sat next to the stove all day. 
1. Apartheid prevented me from seeing my father because he was white.  Apartheid prevented other kids from seeing their fathers too. Some fathers  worked far away in the mines. Others were in prison or in exile. 
1. In Soweto, religion was very important. Women on our street held prayer  meetings. We prayed and sang a lot. My grandmother thought my prayers  were powerful because I prayed in English. When we hosted prayer  meetings, she always asked me to pray. I felt like I was helping people. 
1. Soweto was a wonderful place, even though it was like a prison. There  were a million people there. There were no stores, no bars or restaurants, no  paved roads. But there was a thriving black-market economy.  
1. Soweto had many informal grocery stores called spaza shops. It also had a  lot of illegal bars called shebeens. Men went to shebeens to drink. 
1. The government gave each family a piece of land. People build shanties  from plywood and corrugated iron. Then they would save money to build a  brick house, one room at a time. My grandmother’s house had two rooms. 
1. My mom and I often stayed at my grandmother’s house. The whole family  would sleep on the floor together. My grandmother rented her two backyard  shanties to laborers. She had a driveway, but did not own a car.  
1. There was no running water inside. We shared one outdoor tap and one  outdoor toilet with six or seven other houses. We could not afford toilet paper.  We used newspaper instead. There were many flies. I was afraid of them. 
1. One day when I was five, it was raining. I did not want to go outside to use  the toilet. So I decided to put a piece of newspaper on the floor and go to the  bathroom there! I really enjoyed it. But I realized that my great-grandmother  Koko was in the room. She couldn’t see me. She asked who was there. I very  carefully finished, put the newspaper in the trash, and snuck out of the room. 
1. When my grandmother and mom came home, Koko said, “Something has  been in the house! I could hear it! There was a smell!” They found my shit in  the trash. My mom thought it came from a demon. This was serious. 
1. My mom gathered the whole community to burn my shit outside. That was  the only way to get the demon to leave our house. Many grannies came over  to pray. They wanted me to help them pray. I prayed to God to kill the demon  that left the shit. But that was me! I worried God might kill me. 
1. I prayed. People sang and prayed. That night, I felt terrible. I apologized to  God. I knew that He had more important things to deal with.

## Chapter 4
1. As a kid, I watched American TV shows. They were dubbed into African  languages. The original English audio was available on the radio. I turned off  the TV sound, and listened to the shows on the radio in English. African  American TV characters who spoke in English seemed foreign to me.  
1. Sharing a language makes people feel connected. Apartheid divided black  people by making sure we didn’t all speak the same language. Schools  taught different languages to different ethnic groups. It made us think we  were all different. But language can also help overcome racism. 
______________________ 
1. One afternoon, my cousins and I were playing doctor. I accidentally  punctured my cousin’s eardrum with a matchstick. My grandmother stopped  the bleeding. Then she beat my cousins with a belt. But she didn’t beat me!  
1. My mother asked my grandmother why she didn’t beat me. My grandmother  said she didn’t know how to hit a white child. She was afraid of bruising me or  killing me. My grandparents both treated me like I was white.  
1. In my family, being considered white made things easier for me. Everyone  was more lenient. I was very naughty, but I didn’t get in trouble. 
1. 99% of the one million people in Soweto were black. I was famous for having  light skin. Many kids hadn’t seen white people before. I got special treatment.  I didn’t realize that this had to do with race.  
1. I spoke English at home. If you are black in South Africa, speaking English  puts you at an advantage. I also learned several languages to talk with other  kids in Soweto. Sometimes we spoke Xhosa, my mom’s home language. She  used Xhosa when she was angry. She spoke many other languages too. 
1. My mom used different languages to cross boundaries and handle situations.  Once I saw her talk back to a racist shopkeeper in his native Afrikaans.  
1. Speaking different languages is a tool I have used my whole life. One time I  overheard some Zulu guys talking about how they were going to mug me. So 
I said to them in Zulu, “Let’s mug someone together!” They laughed. They  were trying to steal from white people.  
1. I was like a chameleon. The color of my skin didn’t change. But I could  change the way people perceived me by speaking their language. 
1. At the end of apartheid, elite private schools started taking students of all  colors. My mom got me a scholarship to an expensive Catholic school. The  white students were wealthy. The black, colored, and Indian kids had  scholarships. We all wore the same uniform. There was no racial separation.  
1. There was the usual teasing and bullying, but it wasn’t about race. I got to  be myself. It was a wonderful experience, but it was not reality. 
1. I switched to a government school. I took an aptitude test. I was put in the  “A” classes. Most of my classmates were white. At recess, I saw tons of black  kids. I was confused. What classes were they in?  
1. I felt like I was seeing my country for the first time. I hadn’t felt separate  before. Everyone was black in the townships. My mom didn’t think twice  about going to a white church. At the Catholic school, kids of different races  hung out together. But at my new school, kids of different races stayed apart.  
1. I didn’t know what to do. An Indian kid from my class rescued me. His  name was Theesan. He was one of the only Indian students. Neither of us fit  in. Theesan was amazed that I could speak different African languages. This  was unusual for a colored person.  
1. Theesan brought me over to some black kids. I spoke to them in their own  languages. They were amazed. They asked why I spoke their languages. I  said, “Because I am black.” They told me I wasn’t black. Being colored meant  I was different, but speaking their languages meant I was like them. 
1. I found out that the black kids were all in the “B” classes. I went to the  school counselor. I asked to switch to the “B” classes. The counselor said,  “You don’t want to be friends with those kids.” But I did want to be friends with  them. She warned me it would ruin my future. I said I would take that chance. 
1. My new school made me realize that I was black. The world saw me as  colored. But I saw myself as the people around me, who were all black.  Despite my white father, I didn’t belong with white kids. Black kids embraced  me. I could be myself.

## Chapter 5 The Second Girl 
1. Christian missionary schools taught black South Africans English, history,  medicine, and law. Nelson Mandela, Steve Biko, and other anti-apartheid  leaders went to missionary schools. Educated people want to be free.  
1. The only way to make apartheid work was to make sure black people did not  get a good education. So the government built Bantu schools. There were no  science, history, or civics classes. Kids learned only what they needed to  know to work in the fields. The education was very basic. 
1. My grandparents had an unhappy marriage. They met and married in  Sophiatown, but soon the government seized their home and bulldozed the  area to build a white suburb. My grandparents moved to a Soweto  neighborhood called the Meadowlands. Then my grandparents divorced. 
1. My mom was a defiant tomboy. She and my grandmother fought a lot. My  mom decided to live with my grandfather instead. But my grandfather didn’t  want my mom either. He sent my mom to live with an aunt in Transkei, the  Xhosa homeland. My mom lived in a hut with fourteen cousins! 
1. The homelands were the original homes of South African tribes. They were  supposed to be “free.” There was no running water or electricity, South  Africa’s white countryside was lush and green. But the black lands were  overpopulated and overgrazed. People were subsistence farmers. 
1. My mom worked in the fields. There wasn’t enough food for her and the  cousins. She was hungry. She sometimes ate dirt to feel full. 
1. My mom learned English at the mission school in her village. She could read  and write. She got a job at a factory. Her pay was a plate of food. 
1. When my mom’s aunt got sick, my mom went back to Soweto. She enrolled  in a secretarial course and got a job as a secretary. She worked very hard. All  her earnings went to her family. She did not feel free. She ran away.
1. My mom only told me a few stories about her childhood in Transkei. She told  me about traumatic experiences. But she never complained. She said we  should learn from the past and not repeat it. She made sure my childhood  was different from hers. 
1. My mom’s name means “She Who Gives Back.” When she was a child,  she took care of younger children in the neighborhood.  
1. My mom named me Trevor, even though it isn’t a biblical name. It has no  real meaning in South Africa. She wanted me to be whoever I wanted to be. 
1. My mom taught me English as my first language. She read to me  constantly. Books were my prized possessions. My mom wanted my mind to  be free. She talked to me like I was an adult. She taught me how to think.  
1. Apartheid ended gradually. As the country opened up, my mom decided we  should move. In the black neighborhood, people saw her as a prostitute with  a white man’s child. She couldn’t afford a white neighborhood. So we moved  to Eden Park, a colored neighborhood. We still didn’t fit in.  
1. Our house was modest, but I had my own room. We got a used car. It  broke down a lot. Still, the car meant freedom. We could choose where to go.  My mom taught me how to work the stick shift.  
1. My mom and I explored the world. We probably went to every park in  Johannesburg. We went on drives in the country. We had simple picnics.  
1. My mom was very frugal. We had old furniture. Our TV barely worked. I  wore secondhand clothes. My mom said her job was to feed my body, my  spirit, and my mind. We always had church, books, and food. 
1. The food wasn’t necessarily good food. Meat was a luxury. But I never felt  poor. Our lives were rich with experience.  
1. My mom took me places black people were not supposed to go. She raised  me as if there were no limitations. I realize now that she raised me like I was  white—believing that I should speak up and that my ideas mattered. 
1. My mother showed me what was possible, even before the end of  apartheid. I was almost six when Mandela was released. My mom had  prepared me for a life of freedom, even before we knew that we would be  free. She taught me there was life beyond the ghetto.

## Chapter 6: Loophole
1. Apartheid never made any sense. For example, Chinese people in South  Africa were classified as black because there weren’t enough Chinese people  to give them their own category. Japanese people were classified as white  because the South African government wanted to have a good relationship  with the Japanese government.  
1. As a kid, I always wanted more. I read tons of books. I ate tons of food. I was  hyperactive. I had good manners, but I had tons of energy and knew what I  wanted. My mom would take me to the park so I could burn off energy. 
1. I played tricks at school. Knives fascinated me. I loved fire. One time I was  playing with fireworks and I dropped a match into a pile of gunpowder. It  exploded in my face. It burned my eyebrows and hair. I created chaos to see  how people would react. I couldn’t help it. 
1. My mom found ways to keep me in line. One time at the grocery store I  begged her for a toffee apple. She said yes. Then she pretended she didn’t  know me! I cried, “You’re my mother!” She told the shopkeeper, “I hope he  finds his mom!” I was upset. My mom had tricked me. 
1. My mom and I debated a lot. She wrote me letters that included quotes from  the Bible. The letters would explain why I needed to respect her and do my  chores or do better in school. I wrote very formal letters back to her.  
1. When I did something really bad, my mom would beat me. This was a  common form of discipline at the time. She always explained why I was being  punished. And she always let me know that she still loved me. 
1. At Catholic school, the nuns would hit my knuckles with a metal ruler, wash  out my mouth with soap, or send me to the principal to be hit. One day, the  principal hit me very gently. I laughed. The school sent me to a psychologist. 
1. The psychologist found that I didn’t have ADHD. I wasn’t a sociopath. I was  creative, independent, and full of energy.
1. Whenever a rule didn’t seem logical, I would find the loophole. I didn’t think  communion rules made any sense. I wanted to take communion. But only  Catholics could take communion, so I wasn’t allowed to. But Jesus was  Jewish, not Catholic! Did that mean Jesus couldn’t take communion? I snuck  behind the altar, drank all the grape juice and ate all the Eucharist! 
1. In sixth grade, a kid was bullying me. So I brought a knife to school. The  principal told me to think hard about whether I wanted to come back to the  school the next year. I said “No.” So I changed schools. 
1. My mom wasn’t mad. She defended me. When she agreed with me that a  rule was stupid, she wouldn’t punish me for breaking the rule. My mom taught  me to question authority. That meant that I also questioned her authority. 
1. When I was around seven, my mom had a boyfriend named Abel. I liked  him. Sometimes he stayed at our house and sometimes we stayed with him.  
1. Abel lived in a white family’s garage in the suburbs. The white family had a  black maid. I played with the maid’s son. At that time, I loved fire. One day, in  the servant’s shed, I showed the maid’s son how to use a magnifying glass to  burn his name into pieces of wood.  
1. We put the magnifying glass and some matches on a mattress and went to  get a snack. When we came back, we were locked out. So we played in the  backyard. Then I noticed some smoke coming from the servants’ shed. Soon,  the whole shed was on fire. The fire spread to the main house.  
1. The white family came home and stared at their burnt house. They asked  what happened. The maid’s son said, “Trevor had matches.” The family didn’t  know what to say. I wasn’t arrested. We didn’t get sued. They kicked Abel out  of the garage. He moved in with us. Abel and my mom had a big argument. 
1. My mom didn’t know what to do. Burning down a white family’s house was  more than a little naughty. I didn’t feel bad about it at all. I still don’t feel bad! I  see it as a series of unfortunate events. Still, that fire made me notorious. 
1. My cousin Mlungisi does not understand how I survived a childhood of  being so naughty. Why did I keep misbehaving after being beaten so much? I  inherited my mom’s ability to forget the pain in life. I remember the bad  things, but I don’t hold onto them. I keep pushing boundaries and breaking  rules.

## Chapter 7: Fufi 
1. I have traveled all over Africa and I haven’t found a place where black people  like cats. In South Africa, black people believe that only witches have cats  and cats are witches.  
1. Once, during a South African soccer match, a cat ran through the stadium  and onto the field in the middle of a game. The security guard thought the cat  was a witch. He killed the cat right on the field. White people were very upset.  The security guard was found guilty of animal abuse. He paid a large fine. 
1. It’s ironic because white people had watched many videos of black people  being beaten to death by white people, but they got upset when a cat was  beaten to death. Black South Africans didn’t see a problem. The guard was  protecting the soccer team from a witch! Black South Africans have dogs. 
1. A month after we moved to Eden Park, my mom brought home two black  cats. I had never had a pet before. My mom didn’t believe in any superstitions  about cats. She didn’t care about what black people were supposed to do.  
1. In black neighborhoods, having a cat would be like wearing a sign  announcing you were a witch. My mom thought that having a cat in a colored  neighborhood would be ok. We let the cats roam around the neighborhood. 
1. One day we came home and the cats had been killed. Someone hung them  by their tails on our front gate. They wrote “Witch” on our wall in Afrikaans. I  wasn’t attached to the cats, so I didn't feel too bad. 
1. Then we got two puppies. They were a mix of maltese and bull terrier. I was  so happy. My mom named them Fufi and Panther. They fought a lot. Panther  was my mom’s dog. Fufi was mine. Panther was smart, but Fufi was dumb. 
1. Years later, Fufi was severely injured when a burglar tried to break into our  house. The vet had to put Fufi down. The vet told us Fufi had been deaf.  
1. I really loved Fufi. She could do lots of tricks. She jumped high. Every day  she climbed over our five-foot wall and waited for us outside the gate.
1. One day Fufi didn’t realize I was home. I watched Fufi climb over our front  wall. I followed her down the street on my bike. Then Fufi climbed over a  neighbor’s wall and into their front yard. I rang the doorbell. 
1. A colored kid answered the door. I said my dog was in his yard. I called  Fufi’s name. The kid called my dog a different name, like “Spotty”! Fufi  couldn’t hear either of us. The kid said it was his dog. We fought over Fufi.  
1. I started to cry. I raced home. I told my mom Fufi had been kidnapped. We  went back to the kid’s house. My mom confronted the other mom. The other  mom lied! She said it was their dog! 
1. We gathered documentation. My mom threatened to call the police. My  mom offered to pay 100 rand. We brought Fufi home.  
1. I was still upset. Fufi loved another boy! But Fufi wasn’t cheating on me.  She was living her life to the fullest! That taught me a lesson about  relationships: you don’t own the thing you love.  
1. Now when my friends tell me about being betrayed, I tell them the story of  Fufi.

## Chapter 8: Robert 
1. When I was 24 years old my mom told me I should find my father. I had not  seen him in 10 years. I didn’t think I would ever see him again. My mom said  it was important to find him so I could know who he was and so that he could  know who I was.  
1. My father is a complete mystery. I still can’t answer many basic questions  about him. Where in Switzerland did he grow up? Why did he come to South  Africa? I have never met my Swiss grandparents. 
1. I know my dad worked as a chef in Montreal and New York. He moved to  South Africa in the late 1970s. He worked in the food industry.  
1. I never called my dad “Dad.” It was too dangerous. So I called him Robert.  
1. I do know that my dad is very clean and precise. He likes to do things for  himself. My dad never married. He likes to travel and have friends over. He is  very private. That’s why he and my mom were never caught together. 
1. My parents were opposites. I am a mix of them both.  
1. My dad hates racism. He never really understood it. So he never followed the  rules of apartheid. In the early 1980s, he opened one of the first integrated  restaurants in Johannesburg. His restaurant was a success. Black people  and white people were curious about eating in the same restaurant. 
1. Some neighbors complained. The government tried to find a way to shut  down the restaurant. But it was very clean. Everything was up to code. So the  government made new rules. There had to be separate toilets for black  people, white people, Indian people, and colored people. That was  impossible. Rather than serve only white people, my dad closed the  restaurant. 
1. After apartheid fell, my dad moved to an integrated neighborhood. He lived  near a park where kids of all races and different countries played together. 
1. I visited my dad every Sunday afternoon. I went with my mom to mixed  church and white church in the mornings, then watched Formula 1 with my  dad in the afternoon.  
1. I celebrated my birthday and Christmas with my dad. Christmas was a big  deal in his house. There were gifts from Santa Claus and a tree. In African  households, people didn’t have Christmas trees. Santa wasn’t a big deal. 
1. On Sunday afternoons, my dad cooked a special German dish called Rösti.  It’s a potato pancake with meat and gravy. My dad didn’t talk much. He was  caring and devoted, but I never really got to know him. 
1. When I was 13, my dad moved to Cape Town. We lost touch.  
1. My mom had married her boyfriend, Abel. Abel did not want my mom to  stay in touch with my dad. Abel was an abusive alcoholic.  
1. I was busy living my life. I survived high school. I became a comedian. My  career took off. But I always wondered about my dad. Did he think about me?  
1. When I turned 24, my mom pushed me to track down my dad. My dad is  very private, so it was hard to find him. He is not on my birth certificate, so the  Swiss embassy couldn’t tell me much about him. I wrote my dad a letter. The  embassy forwarded it to my dad. He wrote back! 
1. I went to visit my dad in Cape Town. We picked up where we had left off.  He made me some Rösti. It turned out my dad had been following my career.  He had a whole album of newspaper clipping about me! I cried. 
1. Seeing him that day made me realize he had chosen to have me in his life.  Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give to another person. 
1. I decided to interview my dad. That was a mistake! What I really wanted  was to have a relationship with him. So we spent some time together. He  asked me what I had learned about him. I said, “You’re extremely secretive.”  He said I was already getting to know him.

## Chapter 9: The Mulberry Tree 
1. The Khoisan people are the Native Americans of South Africa. The Khoisan  were nomadic hunter-gatherers. They were in South Africa before tribes like  the Zulu and Xhosa migrated from the north.  
1. White male colonists around Cape Town fathered children with Khoisan  women. Those were the first mixed people in South Africa. 
1. Dutch colonists brought slaves to South Africa from many other colonies.  These slaves mixed with the Khoisan, and colonists continued to father  children with Khoisan women too. Generations of these mixed race children  eventually formed a new race: colored people.  
1. Colored people don’t have a clear heritage. Most speak Afrikaans. Much of  their culture is Afrikaaner. Even though black people have suffered a lot in  South Africa, at least they know who they are. Colored people don’t know. 

1. There was a big mulberry tree at the end of our street in Eden Park. Kids  used to play together under the tree. I didn’t have friends in Eden Park. I was  always different. In white and black neighborhoods, no one looked like me. In  the colored neighborhood, everyone looked like me, but I still didn’t belong. 
1. It was hard to deal with how other colored people treated me. If you are an  outsider trying to assimilate, people accept you. But when you’re an insider  who doesn’t fit in, people don’t forgive you. That’s what happened to me. 
1. During apartheid, colored people were second class citizens. Sometimes,  colored people could be reclassified as white. Your skin needed to be light  enough, your hair needed to be straight enough, and you needed to talk a  certain way. Then all you needed to do was denounce your own people. 
1. Legally, a white person was someone who appeared white or was accepted  as white. It was arbitrary! People could change racial categories.  
1. Colored people lived in limbo. A common slur was “bushman.” People were  afraid of being called black. When apartheid was over, everything changed.
1. I was mixed but not colored. But I looked colored. So people saw me as a  colored person who didn’t want to be colored.  
1. Some people in Eden Park hated me for my blackness. I was proud of my  Afro. I spoke African languages. People called me a “bushman.” Other people  in Eden Park hated me for my whiteness. My father was white. I spoke  perfect English. I barely spoke Afrikaans. They said I was snobby. 
1. One time some kids stole my brand new bike. My cousin Mlungisi found the  kids and brought my bike back. I was bullied a lot.  
1. One day I was picking mulberries. A bully knocked them out of my hand. I  shrugged and picked more mulberries. A group of kids started throwing hard  mulberries at me and calling me names. It hurt! I was covered in juice. I cried.  
1. When I told my mom, she laughed. She was relieved that it was berry juice  and not blood all over me. My mom always found humor in dark times. 
1. Later, my mom’s boyfriend Abel showed up. He was drunk. Sometimes  Abel joked with me, but he had a temper.  
1. Abel saw I had been crying. I started to tell him about the berries. My mom  warned me not to tell Abel. But I wanted him to be on my side, so I told him  anyway. Abel was silent. He got very angry. 
1. Abel asked me to take him to the boys. I watched as Abel beat the main  boy. At first it felt good to get revenge. But then I could see that Abel was just  taking out his rage on this boy. Abel forced the boy to apologize to me. 
1. Looking in the boy’s eyes, I could see how much we had in common. We  were just kids. He had probably been bullied too. I felt like I had made a  terrible mistake. Later, Abel and my mom had a big fight about his temper. 
1. Then the boy’s dad came over to confront Abel. At that point, Abel was very  drunk. Abel didn’t have a gun yet. But he still scared the man. He said, “I will  kill you.” The boy’s dad drove away quickly.

## Chapter 10: Valentine's Day 
1. My mom always gave me little pieces of advice about women. She said being  a man was about who you are, not how much you earn. Men and women  could be equal. My mom wanted me to treat women with respect.  
1. These lessons were about grown-up relationships. My mom was so worried  about teaching me how to be a man that she didn’t teach me how to be a  boy. She even lectured me about sex. It was very awkward. 
1. I was twelve years old. It was my first year at the public primary school. I  didn’t really understand Valentine’s Day. Students sold flowers and cards as  a fundraiser. A friend told me that on Valentine’s Day you tell someone you  love them and they tell you they love you back.  
1. Kids asked who my valentine was. They agreed I should ask Maylene. I used  to walk home with Maylene. She was smart, cool, and cute. I liked her. I didn’t  have a crush on her, I just liked to hang out with her.  
1. Maylene was the only colored girl at school. I was the only mixed kid. No one  else at school looked like us. Some white girls said, “You have to ask  Maylene! You’re the only two!” I decided to ask Maylene to be my valentine. 
1. I didn’t know anything about having a girlfriend. I learned that you are not  supposed to talk to the person you like. Your friends talk to her friends. So my  friends talked to Maylene’s friends. Everything was set. She would say yes. 
1. One day on the way home from school, we stopped in front of McDonald’s. I  worked up the courage to ask Maylene to be my valentine. She said yes. We  kissed for a second. It was great. 
1. I saved money and bought Maylene flowers, a teddy bear, and a card. I wrote  a poem for her. But when I got to school, Maylene told me she couldn’t be my  girlfriend. A boy named Lorenzo had asked her and she said yes. I felt awful.  
1. Lorenzo was white. He was good-looking. He was dumb but very popular with  girls. I was devastated, but I understood why Maylene had chosen him.

## Chapter 11 Outsider 
1. Gas was expensive. My mom got as many miles as possible out of each  gallon of gas. She turned off the car engine every time we stopped in traffic.  She would always coast when driving downhill.  
1. Sometimes we had very little money for gas. Instead of turning the engine on  and off while we were in traffic, my mom made me get out of the car and  push it. People thought the car had broken. They offered to help.  
1. I was embarrassed. I took off my school uniform jacket so other kids at school  wouldn’t see me pushing the car like the Flintstones.  
1. In eighth grade, I started at Sandringham High School. At the time, most  black kids went to public schools in townships and former homelands.  Wealthy white kids and a few black, colored, or Indian kids went to private  schools. Sandringham was a mix of public and private. It was like a charter  school in the U.S.. It was huge. It had tennis courts and a swimming pool. 
1. Sandringham was like a microcosm of post-Apartheid South Africa. Students  of all races were pretty integrated. Cliques were still based on color, but  everyone blended together. I was the only mixed kid out of one thousand. 
1. I didn’t naturally fit into any group. I was too black for the colored kids. The  white kids did things that required money, and we didn’t have any money. 
1. I walked to school and was late every single day. During assembly, a prefect  would read the names of the kids who had detention. Because I was always  late, I was always on that list. The one day I did not get detention, the whole  school started cheering for me. 
1. After assembly, everyone would run to buy food at the tuck shop, a small  food stall on campus. There was always a long line. The best food would sell  out. I was the fastest kid at school. I would run as fast as I could to be first in  line. I was notorious. Kids started paying me to buy food for them. 
1. I was an overnight success. Rich, fat, white kids were my best customers. I  took the five highest bids per day. I started making money. I used it to buy  lunch. I could pay to take the bus home from school.  
1. I found my niche. I could still move between groups and blend in, like a  chameleon. I played sports with the jocks. I talked about computers with the  nerds. I danced with the kids from the townships. 
1. I was like a drug dealer, but for food. I was still an outsider, but people  invited me into their circles temporarily. I might not have belonged to any one  group, but I could use humor to be part of any group.  
1. I wasn’t popular, but I wasn’t an outsider. I was everywhere with everybody,  but I was still alone.

1. I don’t have any regrets about the things I’ve done. I only have regrets about  the things I have NOT done, choices I did NOT make, things I did NOT say.  
1. In high school, I was not attractive to girls. I had terrible acne. We didn’t have  money for good haircuts, so I had a huge Afro. My school uniforms were too  big—that way we could save money on clothing. I was tall and awkward. 
1. I learned that cool guys get girlfriends. Funny guys get to hang out with cool  guys and the cool guys’ girlfriends. I didn’t even try to get a girlfriend. 
1. I went to school with a girl named Johanna on and off for many years.  Johanna was popular but we were friends. Her best friend was Zaheera.  Zaheera was colored. She was very beautiful but extremely shy. Boys weren’t  interested in her. Johanna and Zaheera were always together. 
1. Dating girls was impossible, but I could talk to girls because I could make  them laugh. I had a huge crush on Zaheera. I wanted to ask her to a dance.  
1. I came up with a plan. I hung out with Zaheera a lot. We talked about  everything, including dating and boys. She was dating a boy named Gary, but  she didn’t like him very much. One day I asked for Zaheera’s phone number.  She said yes! We talked on the phone that night. I didn’t tell her how I felt. 
1. Zaheera and Gary broke up and got back together a few times. I waited.  
1. One day, after a school holiday, I noticed that Zaheera wasn’t at school. I  asked Johanna about Zaheera. Johanna told me that Zaheera had moved to  America! Her dad got a job in the U.S. and the family emigrated. 
1. I told Johanna I was sad about Zaheera moving. Johanna said that Zaheera  was sad too—she had had a crush on me all along! She was just waiting for  me to ask her out.  
1. Asking Zaheera to be my girlfriend would have changed my life. But I didn’t  have the courage. And now she was gone.

## Chapter 13: Colorblind 
1. In every nice neighborhood, at least one white family doesn’t keep up their  house or the yard. My mom found a house like this and bought it. That is how  my black family ended up living in Highlands North, a white neighborhood 
1. Highlands North was a middle-class white suburb. In Soweto, I was the only  white kid in a black township. In Eden Park, I was the only mixed kid in a  colored neighborhood. In Highlands North, I was the only mixed kid in a  mostly Jewish neighborhood. Not many people left the neighborhood. 
1. I didn’t make friends in Highlands North for a long time. All the houses had  walls topped with electric wire. The houses were like fancy prisons! I could  always hear kids playing behind the walls. I would peek over the fences. 
1. Finally I became friends with black kids. They were the children of domestic  servants. For a long time, they were my only friends. 
1. At Sandringham High School, I became friends with a kid named Teddy. We  were both very mischievous. Teddy made me feel normal.  
1. Teddy’s mom was a domestic servant for a family in a wealthy suburb near  my school. Teddy and I walked all over Johannesburg together.  
1. Teddy and I liked to wander around a mall. We would reach our arms through  a metal gate and grab some chocolates. The chocolates were filled with  alcohol. I loved alcohol. We stole many chocolates over several months! 
1. One Saturday night, a mall cop caught me. Teddy and I ran. At least twelve  mall cops chased us! The cops knew me and my mom. If they caught me, I  would be in big trouble. We ran and ran as they chased us. It was awesome! 
1. Teddy and I ran in different directions. I squeezed through a hole in a fence  and finally reached my house. Then I waited for Teddy. He never came.  
1. Teddy’s parents arrived. They said Teddy had been arrested for shoplifting.  My mom asked if I had been involved. They said no—Teddy told them he was with another kid. My mom was skeptical, but I had an alibi. Or so I  thought… 
1. The next day, the principal called me into his office. He and my homeroom  teacher told me Teddy had been arrested. I pretended I didn’t know. They  told me Teddy was expelled! The officers were still trying to find the other  boy. 
1. I denied shoplifting with Teddy. The principal played some video  surveillance footage from the mall. He asked me to watch the video. My heart  was pounding. I was worried about being expelled or going to jail.  
1. The video showed me and Teddy reaching through the gate for the  chocolates. It showed us running away. The principal paused the video.  There I was, in the middle of the frame.  
1. I thought the principal was going to ask me to confess. But he didn’t.  Instead, he asked if I knew if Teddy had any white friends. I was confused. 
1. I realized that the video camera was making me look pale. I could see  myself on the video, but everyone else thought it was some white kid.  
1. The principal said he knew I was Teddy’s best friend. Instead of assuming  the second shoplifter was me, the principal assumed I would know who the  “white kid” in the video was.  
1. My teacher asked me about all the white boys in our class. I was amazed.  The teacher and the principal had such rigid ideas about race that they  couldn’t see that the “white kid” in the video was me.  
1. I waited and waited for everyone to figure it out. But they never did. My  mom never got a call about me being the second shoplifter.

## Chapter 14: The Dance 
1. South Africa has 11 official languages. English is an international language.  Most people know at least some Afrikaans. Many people speak Zulu. 
1. Even when people don’t speak the same language, they figure things out  from context or translation. Somehow this works, except when it doesn’t...
1. I made and sold pirated CDs. By the end of high school, I had a mini-empire.  I convinced my mom to buy me a computer for school. I actually just wanted  to surf the Internet and play games. I also downloaded music and porn.  
1. In 12th grade there was a big “matric” dance. I didn’t understand all the rituals  around it. But I was a funny guy, not one of the cool guys with girlfriends. 
1. My friend Tom sold CDs for me at his poor government school. Once, Tom  took me to a talent show. He told me to wear my Timberland boots. I had  bought the boots to dress like American rappers.  
1. The MC introduced “a rapper from America.” Tom told me to go onstage. I  was confused. The talent show organizers had paid Tom to bring an  “American rapper” to the talent show. The “American rapper” was me! That’s  why Tom wanted me to wear my Timberland boots. Tom did some terrible  beat-boxing and I made up a rap. People cheered. 
1. One afternoon, Tom and I were talking about how I didn’t have a date for the  matric dance. Tom said he could get a girl to go with me. We made a deal: I  would give him more of the profit from CD sales, and he would find a date for  me. He said my date would be the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. 
1. Tom told me he found a girl to go to the dance with me. Tom took me to the  girl’s house. The girl, Babiki, was very beautiful. I was stunned and happy! 
1. Tom and I hung out with Babiki and her sisters a few times. It was fun.  Whenever we said goodbye, Babike would hug me. One time she gave me a  little kiss. I had a girlfriend! But I was still nervous about the dance.
1. My stepfather, Abel, worked on cars in our garage. He always had 10 to 15  cars in our driveway, the yard, and on the street.  
1. Tom told Abel about my date. Abel said I could borrow a red Mazda for the  dance. But I really wanted to borrow his BMW. Abel said no.  
1. Tom made a deal with Abel: If Abel saw Babiki and agreed she was the  most beautiful girl he had ever seen, Abel would let me take the BMW. We  introduced Abel and Babiki. She was beautiful! Abel let me take the BMW.  
1. Now I needed something to wear. My mother did not believe in spending  money on clothes. My friend Bongani said he would give me a makeover. My  mom gave me money. Bongani and I went shopping. 
1. Bongani said I should buy one expensive item of clothing. Everything else  could be basic. I bought a long leather jacket and some black pants.  
1. Now I needed to fix my hair. I had an Afro. Some girls suggested cornrows,  but my hair was too unruly. So I got my hair relaxed. The relaxer burned my  scalp! Then I got cornrows. I looked really good. 
1. The big night arrived. Tom helped me get ready for the dance. I asked Abel  for the keys to the BMW. But Abel was drunk. He refused to let me take the  BMW. So I drove the Mazda. I was an hour late to pick up Babiki. 
1. I got lost driving to the dance. We arrived two hours late. When we finally  parked, Babiki refused to get out of the car. I asked Bongani for help. 
1. Bongani went out to the car. When he saw Babiki, he yelled, “This is the  most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen!” No one could believe she was my  date. I was humiliated. Babiki wouldn’t leave the car. I thought I’d messed up.  
1. Then Bongani realized that Babiki didn’t speak English. Even though I had  spent time with her, I had never spoken with her. She was very shy. She had  spoken Pedi with Tom and Abel. She only knew a few words in English. 
1. I was used to people speaking in many different languages. I always  thought about those conversations in English.  
1. I realized why Babiki didn’t want to go into the dance. I asked the other kids  if they spoke Pedi, but no one did. I never got to go to the dance. I drove  Babiki home. She kissed me! We said goodbye.

## Chapter 15: Go Hitler! 
1. German schools teach children about the horrors of the Holocaust. British  schools teach about how shameful colonialism was. In South Africa, we  learned about our country’s history without a sense of judgment or shame.  
______________________ 
1. When I was in 9th grade, three Chinese students transferred to my school.  Bolo’s parents sold pirated video games at flea markets. Soon Bolo started  hacking kids’ PlayStations and selling pirated games at school. Bolo’s white  friend Andrew was a computer geek. He also sold bootleg CDs. 
1. One day, I overheard Andrew and Bolo saying that black kids were taking  advantage of them. The black kids would promise to pay for pirated CDs and  games later, but they never paid. The black kids knew that Andrew and Bolo  too were scared to ask for the money they were owed. 
1. I became Bolo and Andrew’s middleman, selling CDs to black kids. I took a  cut of their sales. I invested the money in more equipment. When Andrew  graduated, he gave me his CD writer. He changed my life! I had everything I  needed for my business. 
1. I kept investing in faster modems and better equipment. I got two middlemen  of my own: Tom and Bongani. Bongani suggested that I sell mixed CDs. I  was like a DJ. I sold a lot of CDs. I started to make a lot of money.  
1. Money gave me new freedom. American chains were a big deal in South  Africa. When a McDonald’s opened in my neighborhood, I used my own  money to eat there. I fell in love with McDonald’s! 
1. The money kept coming. I bought a cordless phone. It had a big range. I  could take it with me to McDonalds. Life was good.  
1. None of this would have happened without Andrew. He was white. He had  access to education, resources, and computers. My family didn’t have access  to those things. I had talent, but I needed help from someone with privilege.
1. My friend Bongani lived in an area known for street parties. Bongani  encouraged me to DJ for parties. Our first gig was a New Year’s Eve party  after graduation. It turned out to be the biggest New Year’s party that year!  
1. People started booking us for parties. That was good. Bongani and I  couldn’t get jobs. While white kids traveled in Europe for a year before  college, I stayed in the township to sell CDs and DJ at parties. 
1. I had access to lots of new music. Sometimes the music was so new that  no one knew how to dance to it. Bongani decided we needed a dance crew.  The best dancer in our crew was Bongani’s neighbor, Hitler. 
1. Hitler was a good friend. He was graceful and talented. He won many  dance competitions. When Hitler danced, the crowd would get very excited.  They would shout, “Go Hitler!” The crowd stuck one arm out in the air. 
1. Hitler is an unusual name, but it is not unheard of in South Africa. People’s  traditional names are chosen with care. English names are chosen at random  from the Bible or famous politicians in the news. 
1. Many black South Africans don’t really know who Hitler was. They only  know that he was powerful. We were never taught to think critically about the  Holocaust and anti-Semitism. No one told us that the architects of apartheid  were big fans of Hitler. We weren’t really taught to think. 
1. Hitler is not the worst thing black South Africans can imagine. The  Holocaust was horrific. But African atrocities like what happened in the Congo  were also horrific. Africans don’t have documentation. The Nazis kept track of  all the people they killed. Colonial powers in Africa didn’t keep count. 
1. Now that Bongani and I had dancers, we got more popular. We started  playing for suburban white people. We were invited to perform at a Jewish  school. I started playing songs. The Jewish kids were ready to party. I  introduced Hitler, and he started dancing. The other dancers were shouting  “Go Hitler!” The audience went silent. A teacher shut off the sound system.  
1. I thought everyone was upset about Hitler’s suggestive dance moves. The  teacher said, “You people are disgusting.” She said, “My people stopped  people like you before and we’ll stop you again.” She was talking about the  Nazis. I thought she was saying that white people would stop us again. We  didn’t understand each other. My friends and I danced out of the school.

1. Money gave me new freedom... When a McDonald’s opened in my  neighborhood, I used my own money to eat there. Why did Trevor use  his money to eat at McDonald’s? What did you do with they money you  earned from your first job? 
1. Many black South Africans don’t really know who Hitler was. They  only know that he was powerful. We were never taught to think  critically about the Holocaust and anti-Semitism. No one told us that  the architects of apartheid were big fans of Hitler. We weren’t really  taught to think. Do you think that students should learn about difficult  historical subjects in school?

1. Alexandra (also called “Alex”) started as a squatter settlement on a white  man’s farm. The farmer sold plots of land to black tenants when it was illegal  for black people to own property. Alex was a slum surrounded by suburbs. 
1. Soweto has become a real city with bigger houses. Alex is still mostly  shacks. It is densely populated. There is no room for Alex to grow. 
______________________ 
1. My friend Bongani brought out the best in everybody. Bongani lived in Alex. I  did not visit him there. He always came to my house in Highlands North.  Bongani called Alex “the hood.” It was bustling and violent. Alex felt chaotic to  me, but there was actually a system. Bongani lived in the nicest area. His  parents sent him to school at Sandringham, away from Alex. 
1. I graduated from high school at age seventeen. Life at home was toxic  because of my stepfather. My mom and I agreed I should move out. I wanted  to go to university to study computer programming, but we couldn’t afford it.  So I sold pirated CDs in the hood. Minibus drivers bought a lot of CDs. 
1. In the hood, things are cheap. You can buy a simple sandwich for almost no  money. A slice of cheese was very fancy. If you have some money, people  say “You’re a cheese boy.” That means you’re not really from the hood.  
1. Bongani and his friends were considered cheese boys. But they insisted they  were from the hood. When apartheid ended, cheese boys were in a difficult  position. Their families had houses. They went to decent schools. They had  awareness of the outside world but no opportunity for upward mobility. 
1. After apartheid, slavery ended. There was a lot of unemployment, even for  people with a high school education. Many young men hung out all day.  
1. In the hood, gangsters are friends and neighbors. Unlike the government,  crime offers people opportunities and money. My life in crime started with  selling pirated CDs. I didn’t realize I was doing anything wrong. 
1. Bongani and I sold CDs and hustled. We made deals. We loaned money and  charged interest. We earned money by making trades for things like VCRs  and shoes. We didn’t always know where those things came from, but we  didn’t worry about it. In the hood, people have different ideas about crime. 
1. My very religious, law-abiding mom once bought two hundred frozen  hamburgers that were probably stolen. We ate them and thanked God. 
1. Bongani and I spent our days hustling and selling odds and ends to  people. At the peak of our business, we had a lot of money. We kept track of  all of our deals on the computer. Afternoons were very busy. Then we would  DJ a party or wind down with some beer. We would listen to gunshots. 
1. After two years I stopped planning to go to college. The hood was  comfortable for me. It gave me a sense of community. It taught me the  importance of sharing. It was hard for people to leave the hood.  
1. One night I was DJing a party. The police busted in. They had gotten a call  about noise. They were wearing riot gear. They told me to shut down my  computer. But my computer took a long time to shut down. A cop shot my  computer! They fired tear gas into the crowd. Police did that a lot.  
1. My music library was gone. I lost my main source of revenue. Our crew  tried to hustle, but we didn’t have any money left.  
1. A friend came by with a digital camera with photos on it from a white  family’s vacation. The camera made me realize that I was committing crimes. 
1. One night our crew was invited to a dance-off in Soweto. Alex and Soweto  were rivals. Soweto was seen as the snobby township. Alex was the gritty,  dirty township. The dancer from Soweto won. There was a fight over a girl.  
1. On the way home, the police pulled over our minibus. They said they found  a gun on the bus. We realized that the cops were looking for a bribe. 
1. The cop took us to jail. When an officer realized I was from Highland North,  he was confused. He called me a rich boy. He asked why I was hanging  around with criminals. He tried to get me to turn on my friends. I refused.  Ultimately, my dad paid my “bail.” It was really a bribe. 
1. I chose to live in the world of hustlers in Alex. But I wasn’t from that world. I  was an imposter. I always knew I could leave. My friends were stuck there.

## Chapter 17: The World Doesn’t Love You 
1. When I was 10 years old I shoplifted some batteries for a toy. A security  guard caught me. He called my mom. My mom said the security guard should  take me to jail. The security guard was confused. What kind of mother would  send her 10-year-old child to jail? He let me go.  
______________________ 
1. My mom never let me get away with things. She gave a lot of tough love,  beatings, and punishment. She disciplined me before the police could. In  Alex, getting arrested was normal. My mom hated the hood. She didn’t like  my friends there. She said Alex didn’t push me to be a better person.  
1. One day, Bongani and I wanted to buy some cheap mobile phones to sell for  a profit. The store was far away. To get there, I could just steal one of my  stepfather Abel’s junk cars. The cars didn’t have proper license plates, but  that didn’t stop me. I just took another license plate from Abel’s garage. 
1. I got pulled over in Hillbrow when I was 19 or 20. I was more worried about  getting in trouble with my parents than with the law. The cop checked the  license plate. It didn’t match the car. The cop took me to the police station.  
1. The car didn’t have a clear title of ownership. I couldn’t prove I hadn’t stolen  it. Carjackings were very common. Sometimes people were murdered for  their cars. I panicked. Prisons in South Africa are very dangerous. 
1. The cop told me I shouldn’t leave jail until I had met with a lawyer. I didn’t call  my parents. A friend borrowed money to pay for the lawyer. I was scared. 
1. Everyone in jail is afraid. I wanted to act tough. In South Africa, colored  gangsters are seen as ruthless. When cops racially profiled me it wasn’t  because I was black. It was because I looked colored.  
1. So when I was in jail, I acted really tough. Everyone left me alone. I relaxed. I  thought maybe prison wouldn’t be so bad. I was still afraid of my parents.  
1. The cops brought a huge, muscular man to jail. He looked like the Hulk. The  cop asked him questions in Zulu. But the man spoke Tsonga. I knew some Tsonga because my stepfather was Tsonga. I helped the Hulk. It turns out he  was a really sweet guy. He was arrested for shoplifting video games.  
1. The Hulk told me his story. During apartheid, he worked on a farm. He was  barely paid. After apartheid, he couldn’t find work. He became a petty thief. I  realized that he wasn’t some horrible criminal. He was just poor.  
1. On the day of my hearing, I was put in a holding cell with white-collar  criminals, people arrested in traffic stops, and hard-core criminals. A young  man was crying. He had been beaten and raped in prison. I was very afraid.  
1. There were around 100 guys in the holding cell. Everyone stayed with  people from their race. I didn’t know where to go. I looked colored, but I was  sure the colored guys were violent gang members. I felt black, but other  people didn’t see me that way. My life flashed before my eyes. I picked white. 
1. I was called into the courtroom. My lawyer and my cousin were there. The  judge asked how I was. I broke down and said, “I’m not fine.” The judge said,  “I didn’t say ‘How are you?’ I said, ‘Who are you?’ State your name.” I said  my name. Everyone in the court laughed. 
1. It turns out I didn’t need to worry. My lawyer had already spoken with the  prosecutor. I had no prior convictions. I wasn’t dangerous. The judge  assigned a date for my trial and set my bail. I was free to go.  
1. A week in jail felt like a very long time. I did not want to go to prison.  
1. I went back to my cousin Mlungisi’s house. When I went back to my mom’s  house I pretended I had just been hanging out with Mlungisi all week. My  mom shook her head. She was disappointed and hurt. She said, “Who do you  think paid for your bail and your lawyer? Do you think I’m an idiot?” 
1. The truth came out. My mom knew because I had taken Abel’s car. My  friend’s father had called my mom as soon as my friend asked to borrow  money to pay my bail. My mom knew everything the whole time.  
1. My mom told me that everything she had ever done was out of love. She  knew that if she didn’t punish me, the world would punish me even worse.  “When I beat you, I’m trying to save you. When they beat you, they’re trying  to kill you.”
