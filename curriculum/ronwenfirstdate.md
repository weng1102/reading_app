* Wen came over to my dorm on our first date in March 1983.
* I was the resident assistant on duty in charge of late night finals snacks.

* The doughnuts and snacks were staged in the dumbwaiter one floor below in the kitchen. 
* I asked him to hand crank the lift but he said it was stuck. 
* I called him a weakling. 
* So he pulled hard. We heard trays of doughnuts crash down the shaft.
* When we went down to the kitchen, we found the doughnuts at the bottom with ants and roaches climbing up the pile.

* Wen rescued a single pristine old-fashioned glazed doughnut at the top.
* Since then, Wen always brings me an old-fashioned glazed doughnut on the anniversary of our first date.
