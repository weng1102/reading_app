# Chapter 1: Year 1976
Eilis Lacey is in her 40s and lives in Long Island, New York. She is married to Tony, a plumber. They have two teenage children, Rosella and Larry. Tony’s big Italian American family lives nearby on the same street, including Tony’s two brothers, their wives, and Tony’s parents.

At times, Eilis finds it “stifling” to live so close to Tony’s parents, brothers and their families. Eilis notes that they can practically see through her windows. And if she were to go on a walk, one of them would ask where she had gone and why.

While Tony works during the day, Eilis works from home as a bookkeeper. She has a quiet and private personality, often feeling more connected to Ireland than the United States. But she has not gone back in many years.

One day, an Irish man comes to her door who she has never met. He knows her name because Tony was a plumber for him and his wife. When Tony was working at their house, he often talked about Eilis. She learns that the Irish man’s wife is pregnant with Tony’s baby. He says he will leave the baby at Eilis’s door when it is born and has no intention of raising it.

Eilis is shocked, confused, and overwhelmed. She sits alone and goes from room to room in their house. She is not sure what to do next, and she begins to question everything about the life she has built.

Tony gets home from his day of work and Eilis manages to avoid him. When it’s time for dinner, Eilis goes through the motions of serving the meal. When Tony begins his usual dinnertime conversation about his day, Eilis lets the stew that she is about to serve him slip off the plate.

## Discussion Questions
1. In what ways does Eilis feel different from her extended Italian family?
1. What challenges do you believe immigrants like Eilis face in a different country than their origin?
1. What was Eilis’ initial reaction to the news of her husband Tony’s infidelity?

# Chapter 2
Every Saturday, Tony’s father would inspect his sons’ cars to see if they were having any problems. Eilis noticed that her father-in-law began to show her more attention when she bought a cheap car. He would always ask her how the car was doing. One day, he finally confessed to Eilis that he had his doubts about her car purchase but acknowledged that it was “turning out to be a bargain.”

If any of the family cars needed fixing, Eilis’s father-in-law sent them to Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D). He owned the best garage and was trusted to fix and work on the cars in Eilis’s family. Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) was known for having the most competitive prices and friendliest service. He was also known to talk a lot about Armenian history.

Eilis also regularly deals with Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) because she manages the accounts for her family business. One day, when visiting the garage, Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) told Eilis that his daughter was getting married and leaving the family business. Eilis and Mr. Dakessian’s (Mr. D’s) daughters both dealt with the bookkeeping for their family’s businesses.

Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D), who is Armenian, also shares a book about Armenian history with Eilis. When she returns to the garage, he tells her that he has a read a book about Ireland. He laments that what happened in Ireland was as bad as what happened in Armenia.

Since his daughter was leaving the family business, Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) offered a job to Eilis to do their accounts. Eilis took the job without hesitation. She did not consult Tony because she knew he would want her to continue looking after the books for his family.

Eilis had been having difficulty getting her husband and his brothers to agree to her method for accounting. Eilis learns from Frank, one of Tony’s brothers, that the other brothers had been complaining about Eilis. Enzo, Tony’s brother, complained that Eilis was trying to tell them how to run their business.

## Discussion Questions
1. In what ways have we seen how Tony’s tight-knit Italian American family treats Eilis?
1. Do you think Eilis’ choice to work for Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) will cause controversy between her and Tony? Or controversy between her and Tony’s family? 
1. Have you ever worked in a family business? Were there any challenges? Would you consider pursuing a business venture with a family member? Why or why not?
1. What do you know about Armenian and Irish history? In what ways do you think Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) saw parallels?

# Chapter 3
At night, when Eilis and Tony are alone, she finally confronts him about the affair. She asks if the Irish man would really leave the baby at their doorstep. Tony whispers that “He means what he says.”

Finally, she asks Tony if he has had other affairs. Tony says, “Nothing. I told you. I promise you. Just this.”

After this exchange, Eilis distracts herself with work. She senses that Tony is avoiding her and does not want to discuss the affair. Eilis  finally tells Tony her position: She will not take care of the baby, no matter what. Eilis says, “It is your business, not mine.”

In response, Tony asks her what they should do with the baby. He acts very sad. Eilis knows that any sympathy or help will make her position seem weak and too soft. She does not answer him.

Eilis decides to speak to Tony’s brother, Frank. She makes an  appointment to see Frank at his law office in Manhattan.

The summer before, Rosella spent a month working in Frank’s law office. Frank decides to pay for the college tuition of Eilis’ daughter, Rosella, because she is hard-working and it is her dream to go to college. Tony finds out, and is upset that no one consulted him. Tony then says that other family members wonder why Eilis and Frank spend so much time together. Eilis reassures Tony, stating that Frank is “one of those men”. Tony makes Eilis promise not to tell anyone.

Eilis visits Frank in New York City at his law office. She reflects on her mother’s 80th birthday in the summer, wishing she could visit Ireland. She misses her mother and brother, Martin. Her brother, Martin, lives 10 miles from their mother. He visits their mother a few times a week.

When Eilis brings up her previous life in Ireland, Tony and her children do not show any interest.

Eilis tells Frank about the affair and the baby, asking for legal advice. Frank tells her legal action would be difficult and could take time to resolve. Eilis learns that the Irish man has visited Frank’s office. She also learns that Tony and Frank’s father visited Frank’s New York office for the first time.

Frank then reveals what will happen with the baby: Tony’s parents will take care of the baby.

Tony is aware of all of this but has not shared this plan with Eilis. Frank wants Eilish to promise she will not tell anyone what he told her.

## Discussion Questions
1. Why do you think Eilis seeks out Frank’s advice?
1. What do you think of the secrecy between the family members? How do you think the secrets are impacting Eilis?
1. How does Eilis feel about home and her family at the end of Chapter 3? How might her current marriage difficulties affect her desire to  return to Ireland?

# Chapter 4
Since the Fiorello family moved to Lindenhurst, they have gathered together every Sunday at one o’clock for a long lunch. These weekly lunches last through the afternoon. The only exception is during the “high summer.” 
Each Sunday, Tony’s mother, Francesca, prepares a meal for her husband, four sons, three daughters-in-law, and eleven grandchildren. Each week, one of the daughters-in-law helps Francesca cook and clean up after the meal.

Francesca tells Eilis that she likes it best when Eilis helps her because she is calm. Francesca adds that since Eilis does not know about Italian cooking, she doesn’t criticize Francesca.

While Eilis likes spending time with Francesca, the Sunday lunches are a strain. She can not eat all of the food, and she is not good at participating in the family banter.
Francesca’s rule for the grandchildren when they sat at the table was to sit quietly and display good manners at all times. When the children left the table, the rest of the amily would talk over each other. This was the worst part for Eilis. On Mondays after the lunch, she would still hear the loud and competing voices of her in-laws in her head.

One day Eilis brought her camera and took a picture of the Sunday lunch. The family posed for the picture and looked happy. Eilis’s mother had no grandchildren in Ireland, and Eilis’s siblings only visited her mother on occasion. Eilis did not send the picture of the Sunday lunch to her mother because she believed it would make her mother sad.

Every Sunday, Tony’s father sat at the head of the table and re-told the story of his mother’s arrival at Ellis Island. His mother was sent back to Italy because something was wrong with her eyes. And she never returned to America; she stayed in Italy. 

A few years earlier, the TV showed the news about the Vietnam war. Eilis’s father-in-law denounced the protestors. He thought the police were too lenient. Eilis thought the protestors were very brave. Eilis said that she would hate it if her son had to go to war. Eilis’s father-in-law said nothing would make him more proud. Eilis was angry that neither Tony or Frank supported her.

As Tony’s father and Eilis continued their argument, Enzo pointed at Eilis and loudly said
“Keep quiet, you!” Enzo followed this by asking Tony,“Can you not control her?”

Even though Tony didn’t support her during the exchange with his father, Eilis almost felt sorry for Tony. He could not go against his father. 
A few days after the argument, Francesca visited Eilis. She was worried that Francesca would ask her to apologize. Instead, Francesca suggested that Eilis no longer come to Sunday lunches. Francesca said, “It struck me that you would be much happier if you didn’t have to suffer through those long Sunday lunches.” Eilis wanted it to be clear to the family, and especially Tony, that this was Francesca’s idea. Francesca said, “I will assure him that it was my idea.”

From then on, the entire family continued to go to 10 o’clock mass together on Sundays. After mass, Eilis would read the Sunday edition of The New York Times when the rest of the family went to lunch.

The only person who questioned Eilis’s absence at the lunches was her daughter, Rosella. She thought her mother had been banished from the lunches. Eilis assured her, “I love my Sundays, so I am not complaining.”

## Discussion Questions
### Question 1:
Do you think Tony (or Frank) should have supported Eilis during the argument between her and his father?

### Question 2:
Should Eilis have sent the photo of the Sunday lunch to her mother? Why or why not?

### Question 3:
How do you think Eilis not attending the Sunday lunches affects their family dynamic?

# Chapter 5
Eilis tries to create opportunities for Tony to tell her about Tony and his mother’s secret plan to adopt the baby. But Tony never brings it up.

One day, Lena, her sister-in-law, sneaks over to Eilis’s house to make sure she is not been by other family members. Lena knows about the situation with the baby and offers her help. She says she’s ready to help: “Anything. If you need money or advice, or just need to talk.”

Eilis receives a letter from her mother that lists all the people she met over the past few weeks.
Eilis notices that Jim Farrell’s name is missing from the list.

Eilis thinks back to the summer when she returned to Ireland after her sister Rose had died. That summer, Eilis and Jim had a romance. It was 20 years ago. However, at that time, Eilis was already married to Tony. She kept her marriage a secret and left when Jim made it clear he wanted to marry her.

During the early years of Eilis and Tony’s marriage, people envied their relationship. They
got married in secret. Tony always wanted to stay by Eilis’ side and didn’t like leaving her for a second. Eilis reminisces about the happy times she shared with him.

Francesca, Eilis’s mother-in-law, comes by and pretends she just found out about the affair and baby. She and Eilis argue, and Francesca refuses to admit she is planning to keep the baby behind Eilis’ back.

Eilis tells Tony she is going to visit her mother in Ireland. Tony asks her to promise that she will come back. Eilis does not reply.

Eilis tells her children, Larry and Rosella, about their father’s affair and the baby. Larry had overheard his uncles joking that Tony had a girlfriend so he knew something was going on. When Larry learns about the baby, he asks Eilis what she is going to do. Eilis replies, “I am going to Ireland. My mother’s eightieth (80th) birthday is on the fifteenth of August...” Larry asks to go to Ireland, too.

Eilis tells Rosella about Tony’s affair and the baby. Rosella cries when she hears the news. When Rosella learns that Larry is also going to Ireland, she says she will go, too. They agree that Rosella and Larry will join Eilis at the end of July after Rosella finishes her internship.

## Discussion Questions

### Question 1:
Are you surprised by Francesca’s actions? If you were in Eilis’ position in that conversation, how would you react?

### Question 2:
How do you think Eilis feels about Jim?

### Question 3:
How do you think Tony feels when his family decides to go to Ireland without him?

### Question 4:
Have you ever been to Ireland? If yees, what did you enjoy there?

### Question 5:
How do you think will this trip change each member of the family? (Eilis, Tony, Rosella, Frank)
# Part 2: Chapter 1
Nancy is the owner of a “chip shop”. She is a widow and has three adult children, Gerard, Miriam and Laura. 
Some neighbors have been complaining about Nancy’s “chip shop” because of the smells and loud late night activity of the customers. 
One night, Nancy was closing early when two people started banging on her door. They continued banging and shouting loudly to get her to re-open the “chip shop.” To get support, Nancy
called Jim Farrell. Since Jim owns the Rafter Bar down the street, he knows how to deal with unruly people. He came over right away and sent the two loud people away. 
Over the past year, Nancy has been having an “affair” with Jim that they have both kept a secret. At Christmas, Jim tells Nancy he wants to be more 
serious and live together and get married. Although Nancy was initially hesitant, they begin to work out the details. A few days later, on New Year’s Eve, Nancy’s daughter Miriam announces that she’s engaged. Nancy and Jim decide that they will announce their own engagement in September after Miriam has her wedding in July.
While Nancy ponders her life, she thinks back to when Jim was in love with Eilis. When Eilis was visiting from America, Jim fell in love with her. At that time, Nancy and George were a couple about to be married. 
Nancy wonders why Jim did not settle down with someone younger and more glamorous. She resolved she would go on a diet, and work to get her figure back. 
The next day, Nancy begins redecorating her home above the “chip shop” in preparation for Miriam’s wedding. Miriam wants the walls painted, the floors stripped, and the television gone. 
Nancy daydreams about her future with Jim. She thinks about moving out of town with Jim. Nancy
had wanted to put a bid on a new site at Lucas Park, but realized she had to consult Jim first. While Nancy was planning her future, her dreaming was interrupted by a knock at her door. It was Eilis. The two begin to catch up, with Nancy noticing Eilis does not bring up Tony during their conversation. While they talked about old times, Nancy did not bring up the summer Eilis returned to Ireland, and how clear it was that Eilis and Jim were in love. At the time, Nancy and George were encouraging Jim to marry Eilis. After Eilis left Ireland without explanation, Nancy later found out that Eilis had been secretly married to Tony. 
While catching up, Nancy asks how Eilis keeps her figure. Eilis reveals her sister-in-laws will notice
if she gains any weight, so she has to be really conscious of what she eats. Nancy encourages Eilis to come her daughter’s wedding, and Eilis agrees. 
Eilis asks Nancy how Jim is doing. Nancy lies and says he keeps to himself but suggests he’s seeing someone in Dublin. After Eilis left, Nancy found a sudden resentment towards Eilis for never explaining why she went back to America. She then realized she should have consulted with Jim before inviting Eilis to the wedding. She decides she will casually tell him about Eilis’s return to Ireland, and wait to see his response.
## Discussion Questions 
### Question 1: 
What do you think about Nancy and Jim’s relationship? Why do you think Nancy referred to their relationship as an “affair”? 
### Question 2: 
Nancy makes multiple references to how she needs to go on a diet to get back to her old figure. How do you think Eilis’s return contributes to this? 
### Question 3: 
How do you think Jim will respond to the news that Eilis is back? Do you think Nancy is worried?
# Part 2: Chapter 2 
Eilis orders a fridge, washing machine, and “cooker” for her mother, without consulting her first. All of her mother’s neighbors watch as the 
deliverymen unload the items. Eilis acknowledges that while she might have consulted her mother first, she wanted the gifts to be a special surprise. 
While the movers are handling the items, Eilis reflects on how her mother’s house has not changed since Eilis left for America. The wallpaper,
curtains, worn rugs, and blankets are all the same. Her mother still did the laundry by hand. 
When Eilis’s mother sees the deliveries, she tells the deliverymen that they are in “the wrong house.” When Eilis tries to explain herself and the surprise gesture, her mother tells her to send the items back. Her mother emphasizes that she did not need Eilis’s help and that “if I had wanted them, I would have ordered them myself.” 
Eilis reflects on her conversation with Frank she had before traveling to Ireland. Frank had met her in a parking lot outside a shopping mall. He handed Eilis an envelope full of $20 dollar bills, amounting to $2,000. He explains that just as his grandfather could have benefitted from some
extra money when meeting relatives in Italy, Eilis could similarly use this money to spend on her family during her travels to Ireland. He says she does not owe him any money. He says he knows it is “a hard time for you. This is just to help you out.” 
The scene returns to Ireland following her mother’s reaction to the surprise delivery. Her mother complains that the new appliances will 
result in a high electricity bill. Eilis observes that her mother has become stronger and more resolute in her opinions since the last time she saw her. Her brother Martin believes this change is only around Eilis. Her mother tells everyone she will think about whether to keep the new
appliances. In the meantime, they sit in the hallway. 
One of the main reasons Eilis suspects her mother opposes the refrigerator is that it discourages frequent visits to town to buy food. Her mother enjoys dressing up and bringing Eilis to meet with town members. 
Eilis’s mother shows Eilis her bank book, revealing a large sum. Eilis’ brother, Jack, bought the house for their mother, which will later be passed down to their brother, Martin. Therefore, the mother does not want or need Eilis’ “charity” money. Additionally, Eilis should not expect a share of the house.
Life with her mother seems mundane with not many activities to do after lunch. Eilis offers to take her mother for a drive in the rental car but her mother refuses. 
One evening, Eilis sits with Martin and asks about Jim Farrell. Martin shares that Jim is doing a good business at the pub. Eilis asks if Jim has a girlfriend in Dublin (referring to what Nancy had suggested). Martin acknowledges that Jim goes to Dublin on Thursdays but is always back by 9pm and works all weekend so doesn’t know when he’d have the time. 
Eilis reflects on her mother’s lack of interest with Eilis’ life in America. Her mother does not ask questions or respond to Eilis’s remarks about Tony,
Larry, or Rosella. Her mother does not appear to remember Mr. D, whom Eilis referred to many times in her letters. At the same time, her mother shares stories and pictures about brothers and their families, talking extensively about her other grandchildren. Eilis rethinks the timing of her visit to Ireland, and wishes she hadn’t come so much earlier than Larry and Rosella. 
As she is writing letters to her family in America, Eilis begins to miss her life there. She thinks about everyone she knows in America and her daily routines. 
When Eilis wakes the next morning, she decides to purchase new matresses and bed sheets for her bedroom. She wants Larry and Rosella to feel
comfortable when they visit. Her mother rejects this idea, stating that it would “pamper” her children, instead of just spending quality time with them. 
Eilis tries to change to subject by bringing up her mother’s upcoming birthday. Her mother emphatically says she does not want any gathering for her birthday. When Eilis says it can just be with family, her mother says “family can often be the worst.” To this, Eilis decides to leave the house for a walk on the main street. 
As she passes Jim Farrell’s pub, she sees him standing at the door. She quickly diverts her gaze, but reconsiders looking back at him. She knows
that she should not engage, but cannot help wanting to meet him and hear his voice.
## Discussion Questions 
### Question 1:  
What kind of relationship does Eilis and her mother have? 
### Question 2: 
How does Eilis feel about her life in America? 
### Question 3: 
How do you think Eilis feels when seeing Jim for the first time? Happy, nervous, curious?
# Part 2: Chapter 3
Jim saw Eilis and wanted to call in her direction to make sure it really was her. Regulars at the bar knew his story with her. He thought someone would have told him that she was back! 
Shane Nolan and Andy worked at the bar. Andy was impatient and cheeky, and Jim found him difficult to get used to. Andy did many sports, and his sports friends became regulars at the pub. 
On the night Jim saw Eilis, he asked Andy to clean the pub and lock up. He made a sandwich with
ingredients that Shane’s wife, Colette, left for him. Before, Colette would come when Jim was upstairs and have tea with him. She talked about many things, including Jim’s bachelor status. She encouraged him to find a wife. 
Colette suggested Nancy Sheridan. Jim was hesitant because he had known Nancy all his life, and he was not sure she would even consider it. Colette did not mention Nancy again, and Jim put no thought into it at first. 
Then, Jim imagined Nancy now, and what it would be like if they were together. A few times, when Jim saw Nancy on the street, he stayed talking to her longer than ever before. She told him how hard it
was to deal with drunken customers. He offered his help if she had any troublesome customers. 
As soon as Jim saw Eilis on the street, he wanted to be alone. He often thought about her since she left over 20 years ago. He wondered if she thought about him, too. He expected to hear from her after she left him in Ireland, but he never heard from her again. Months after Eilis left, Jim learned she was a married woman. 
Rumors spread around town about Eilis and Jim, and about how Eilis had a husband in America. Jim hated how the rumors spread. But eventually people found other things to gossip about. 
The summer after Eilis left, Jim drove to Courtown on a Sunday night to a dance. Just as the season was ending, he met Mai Whitney with ta group from the rugby club in Gorey. Mai did not seem to have a boyfriend, and he asked her to dance. 
Over the next few months, they would go to different dances. Jim did not see Mai as much as he wanted because of their busy schedules. Jim eventually invited Mai to see the bar and she spent the night in his apartment. When Mai returned from the bathroom, Jim was encouraged by her comment,“I would have that bathroom completely redone.” 
One evening, a man came into the Jim’s bar. He asked how long it had been since Jim and Mai broke up. Even though Jim had seen Mai a few days prior,
he did not say anything. The man said that Mai would be bringing her new boyfriend to the dance in Wexford on Saturday. 
The following Saturday, Jim went to Wexford. After a few dances, he saw Mai walk onto the dance floor with a man. He waited to see if she would switch dance partners. She did not. He watched them come out again for a slow dance, then he left and drove home. 
The next evening as they were traveling to a Rugby dance, he asked Mai what she had done the night before. She said she needed a night in, and that she went to bed early. 
They danced and chatted, and he dropped her off as usual. He said he would pick her up at the usual time the following Sunday, but he knew he would never see her again. 
If he were to see Mai now it would mean nothing to him. With Eilis Lacey, he still wondered if he might have convinced her to stay.
## Discussion Questions 
### Question 1: 
Do you think Jim would have a relationship with Nancy Sheridan if Colette had not suggested it? 
### Question 2: 
If you were in Jim’s position, what would you say to Eilis after seeing her for the first time in 20 years? 
### Question 3: 
What kind of impact to do you think Jim’s history with Eilis and Mai had on him?
# Part 3: Chapter 1 
The chapter begins with Nancy and her daughter, Laura, going for a walk. Nancy complains that Laura is too fast. They had agreed that Nancy would walk every morning to lose weight for Miriam’s wedding. 
Laura wants her sister, Miriam’s wedding to be perfect. Miriam, however, believes it is “just a day”. 
One day, Nancy heads to Market Square. She runs into Nora Webster, and her sister Catherine. Both Catherine and Nora are well dressed. Nancy wishes she were wearing better clothes. The two sisters ask about the wedding and whether Nancy has a dress yet. Nancy responds that she plans to look for a dress in Dublin soon. Catherine promises to send Nancy the phone number of a saleswoman at a dress shop. 
Nancy asks Jim to drive her to the dress shop in Dublin on an upcoming Thursday. Before the trip to Dublin, Nancy gets her hair done and chooses a nice outfit to wear. She wants to look good for Jim. 
In the car to Dublin, Nancy struggles to make conversation with Jim. She reflects that if her late husband George was driving, there would not be a moment of silence. He was always laughing and happy. Nancy feels “disloyal” to both George and Jim, because she thinks about both of them. Nancy considers telling Jim that she invited Eilis to the wedding, but decides not to in the end. 
As Nancy approaches the dress shop, she is nervous about the outfit she chose. She was worried her clothes might smell like the chip shop. She feels out of place but resolves to be brave. 
Nancy enters the dress shop of Miss Metcalfe. Miss Metcalfe tells Nancy that she doesn’t need to lose weight for the wedding. She decides on a dark blue dress with white stripes. 
Nancy tells Miss Metcalfe about Jim, and her dream of marrying him in Rome the following Spring. Miss Metcalfe brings a wedding dress for Nancy to try on but warns her of the price. Nancy is unsure about buying it before consulting with Jim, but does so anyway. As she is waiting for Jim to pick her up, she decides not to tell anyone about her purchase. 
##  Discussion Questions 
### Question 1: 
Nancy compares her late-husband George to Jim. How are they different from each other? 
### Question 2: 
Why does Nancy not tell or consult Jim before buying the wedding dress? Do you think she should have?
# Part 3: Chapter 2 
Eilis decided to get away from her mother and brother, Martin, after her mother insisted that she didn’t want to hear another word about America. Eilis decided to go to Martin’s house in Cush. 
The house in Cush had not been cleaned in a long time. The mattress was stained and the bedclothes were old. Eilis went to Wexford and bought a new bed, a mattress, an easy chair, a deck chair, and some fresh towels and bedclothes. She also bought sheets, pillows, blankets, and a bathing suit. She also bought groceries. 
Tonight would be the first night that Eilis would sleep alone in a house. It was something she would often dream about. It was strange how close she had lived to Tony’s family and how little she thought about them now. She hoped Rosella and Larry would like Ireland when they came. 
Tony’s father had never really learned how to say Eilis’s name. A few weeks before she left for Ireland, Tony’s father went to the garage where Eilis worked. He praised Eilis in front of the workers. Eilis asked Frank if his father had been sent by her mother-in-law because they did not want Eilis to feel unappreciated. Frank said he did it on his own accord. 
In the weeks before her trip, Tony would silently watch Eilis get ready for her trip. Larry asked Eilis if she and Tony were splitting up. Eilis said that she didn’t know, but that she will always love Larry and Rosella, and so would their father. 
On the day Eilis left, she did not want Tony to drive her to the airport. No one else could drive her so Tony ended up bringing her to the airport. 
Eilis knew that Tony could sometimes easily see what she was thinking. He rarely asked her questions though, and he had a way of pretending to know nothing except what she told him. 
Eilis counted backwards from the time the baby was due and realized it had been conceived the previous November or December. During this same time, Eilis and Tony had suddenly become passionate with each other again. It was a happy time for her, but then she realized the affair must have happened during the same period. 
When they got to the airport, Eilis wanted to let him know of the consequences he would face if he and his mother chose to keep the baby. But she decided against it. As she walked into the airport, she did not turn around to wave at him. 
In Cush, Eilis took a quick swim in the ocean. She went to take a stroll afterwards, and saw a man coming towards her. It was Jim Farrell, and she hardly knew what to do. 
## Discussion Questions 
### Question 1: 
Do you think Eilis and Tony should split up? 
### Question 2:
Do you think Eilis will tell her family in Ireland about her situation in America? 
### Question 3: 
Do you think Jim and Eilis will reconnect?
# Part 3: Chapter 3 
Jim and Nancy began to plan their wedding. Rather than getting engaged now and married quickly, Nancy wants to plan the wedding and engagement strategically. She mentions a wedding in Rome the following spring. Nancy does not want attention to be drawn away from her daughter, Miriam’s, wedding. Jim wants to be settled in his relationship as soon as possible, but does not think he will be able to change Nancy’s mind.
When the pub gets busy, Jim forgets about when the wedding will occur. He enjoys talking to Andy, who works for him. And on Mondays, he looks forward to talking to Shane, especially about his children. 
One day, when Shane’s wife Collette comes into the bar, she asks why Jim is so moody. Jim wanted to confide in Collette about how to move the wedding along faster. But, his father once told him to never over share as a bar man. 
He did trust Colette, but could not be sure the news of his engagement would spread to her mother or sisters. Jim believes Colette has suspicions because Shane had answered a phone call from Nancy. And another night when Nancy called, Andy joked that,“your girlfriend’s on the phone looking for you.” 
Nancy came to visit Jim’s house later the following night, and it was evident she felt more comfortable in his space. Jim wondered if Nancy would be happier with living together more than life after marriage. Jim began to wonder what would happen if he asked her to give him one good reason to delay the wedding until spring. However, he did not know how he would tell her how lonely he feels in his life. 
When Martin Lacey walked into the bar, Jim did his best to avoid him. Martin tells Jim that Eilis and her mother are not getting along well. Martin mentioned that Eilis has gone to Martin’s house in Cush to get away. 
After hearing the news about Eilis’ return, Jim began to feel almost as sad about losing Eilis as he had twenty years ago. He did not want to chance Eilis leaving Ireland again before he could see her. Jim decided that when Shane arrives to the bar, he would drive to Cush to see Eilis. 
He had a vague idea of where Eilis’ was staying. Jim began to drive around Cush and walk along the houses, and ran into a woman. The woman, Lily Devereux’s mother, recognized him because of his pub. Jim sees Lily Devereux around his town sometimes, and knows he has to be careful about what his says next. News would spread that he came to Cush. When Jim says he is looking for Martin’s house, the mother points Jim in the direction. 
Jim was debating how to best approach Eilis. He waited by her door, hoping she would see him from her window. He wondered if he should shout her name, but began to wonder if she would recognize his voice after 20 years. Jim then went down to the strand, to walk alone with his thoughts. 
When Jim got to the strand, he saw Eilis walking towards him. Jim felt pure disbelief when making eye contact with her. Eilis asked how Jim knew she was in Cush. When Jim began to explain why he wanted to speak to her again, she asked him to walk back with her to her house.
Jim immediately began to notice how Eilis had changed over the years. He noticed she had more ease and confidence than she did 20 years ago. 
Eilis mentions that she heard about the woman he is seeing in Dublin. Jim says “Who told you that?” When Eilis says,“Everyone knows it,” Jim responds, “Except me.” 
Jim wants to ask her why she came to Ireland alone, but cannot not bring himself to ask. When they arrived back to her house, he took her hand to help her climb the sand. 
When Jim asked if Eilis had been back to Ireland, Eilis said this was her first time since “then”. Jim wished he could have been with Eilis all those years, but also wishes Eilis knew about Nancy. Jim reveals
he feels sad seeing Eilis again, and asks if she ever thinks about him. Eilis does not answer him. They shake hands and he returns to Enniscorthy.

# 4: Chapter 1 
It’s the day of Miriam’s wedding. Gerard is supposed to walk his sister, Miriam, down the aisle, but he is hungover. He was out late drinking at Jim’s pub. 
Nancy sees Eilis at the wedding and observes her interacting with a group of other guests. Eilis nods and listens but doesn’t talk. Nancy didn’t think there was anything special about Eilis when they were younger, but now she stands out. She seems like a different person after her time in America and Nancy wonders what happened. 
The wedding reminds Nancy of her late husband, George. She weeps and thinks about her good memories of him and about how much he would have loved the wedding. 
At the reception, Gerard makes a speech, reading from a script his sisters helped him write. But he goes off script and makes a crude joke about four nuns. Nancy is embarrassed and is afraid of Jim’s reaction. However, Jim received it well,“making a gesture towards her of mock despair”. Gerard seems to realize that the joke is a mistake and finishes his speech.
Nancy and Jim dance together, and she enjoys how close they are to each other. She believes this encounter was fate. If Eilis had not gone to America, and if her late husband had not died, she and Jim would not be together. 
The guests say their farewells at the end of the night. Nancy tries to find Jim to travel home together, but she can’t find him. He disappeared after Nancy briefly saw him talking to Eilis. As Nancy leaves, she looks back in case he appears, but he doesn’t.
## Discussion Questions 
### Question 1: 
What do you think of Nancy’s attention to Eilis? Do you think her feelings towards her have changed? Why or why not? 
### Question 2: 
Do you think the wedding events bring Nancy and Jim closer together? How has Nancy and Jim’s relationship evolved?

# Part 4: Chapter 2 
This chapter shows the wedding from Eilis’ point of view. When Eilis is getting ready for the wedding, her mother advises Eilis on what to wear. Eilis’s mother notes,“The whole town will be looking at you. And they will all have an opinion.” 
At the wedding, Eilis greets Nancy, but Nancy’s response sounds “like an afterthought”. Other wedding guests talk to Eilis. She mostly nods and listens.
During the ceremony, Eilis’ minds wanders. She thinks about Nancy’s late husband and how much has changed in the time she was in America. 
Eilis imagines what would have happened if Jim had stayed when he found her at Martin’s beach house in Cush. She envisions him asking her what no one in Ireland has asked her yet: What was it like, being away all these years? 
Eilis realizes how different she is from the other wedding guests. Everyone has their own life, their own stories. She felt like an outsider in America, and she feels like an outsider in Ireland. 
Eilis thinks about Jim and what they could have had. She notices that he sits alone at the reception and seems lonely. This is strange to Eilis, as she was told he has a girlfriend in Dublin. 
Eilis and Jim briefly leave the reception to go to a quieter space. Eilis shares that she wishes Jim had not left so soon the last time they saw each other. They quickly return to the main room. 
When the guests are leaving for the night, Jim tells Eilis that he can’t drive due to the alcohol he drank. She gives him a ride, and they make plans to discretely meet back at Jim’s place.
## Discussion Questions 
### Question 1: 
Why do you think Eilis’s mother is so concerned about what Eilis wears to the wedding? 
### Question 2: 
The last time Eilis and Jim had a romance, it did not end well for everyone. Do you think history will repeat itself? In what ways is their relationship now different than when they were younger? 
### Question 3:
Neither Eilis nor Jim have been transparent about their current relationships with other people. Why do you think that is? What does this tell us about these characters?
# Part 4: Chapter 3 
Jim was nervous at the thought of Eilis and Nancy showing up at his door at the same time. When waiting for Eilis, he expects Nancy might call. If Nancy calls, he figures he would let the phone ring, and pretend he had not heard it. 
Jim knew it would be easier if Eilis did not come. It occurred to him Nancy might show up, and visit him without any warning. He was nervous at the idea of Nancy and Eilis meeting, and wondering what the other was doing at Jim’s apartment.
Once Eilis arrives at Jim’s house, he quickly lets her in. Jim asks Eilis about her children, and she begins to tell him about their personalities and plans for the future. Jim notices that Eilis has still not mentioned her husband. He tries to be as present as possible during their conversation. He is aware they might never have a conversation like this again. 
Jim knew he had to be calculated in how he asked about Eilis’s husband. He did not want to appear too interested. If he did ask her, and she said she was happily married, he would feel disappointment. 
Suddenly, Jim asked “Are you still living with your husband?” Initially, Eilis responded “He drove me to the airport, I guess that says something”. But, Eilis then said she was not sure what to say. Jim realizes Eilis was letting him know there was a problem at home. Since Jim asked an abrupt question, Eilis asks him why he never married. 
Jim began to contemplate how to respond. Jim could tell Eilis he is engaged to Nancy, and figured she would keep the secret. He saw Eilis as a trustworthy person. Instead of answering, Jim then asked if there are things she regrets. Eilis responded if she was stronger, she never would have left Ireland, but then she would not have her children. 
After Eilis responded, she then asked if he had any regrets. He told her he wished he followed her to Brooklyn, or ran after the boat she left on. When she asked if there was anything else he regretted, he told her he regretted never “spending a night together”. 
Eilis began to laugh, and said she was not expecting him to say that. Jim then asked if she had felt that. When she did not reply, he began to suggest they could stay together in a hotel in Dublin. Eilis asked for time to consider it. She could time it so that she spent the night in Dublin, and then picked up her children from the airport the next morning. She promises to think on it, and said she would leave Jim a note to let him know her decision.
## Discussion Questions
