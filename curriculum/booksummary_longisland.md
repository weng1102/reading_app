# Chapter 1: Year 1976
Eilis Lacey is in her 40s and lives in Long Island, New York. She is married to Tony, a plumber. They have two teenage children, Rosella and Larry. Tony’s big Italian American family lives nearby on the same street, including Tony’s two brothers, their wives, and Tony’s parents.

At times, Eilis finds it “stifling” to live so close to Tony’s parents, brothers and their families. Eilis notes that they can practically see through her windows. And if she were to go on a walk, one of them would ask where she had gone and why.

While Tony works during the day, Eilis works from home as a bookkeeper. She has a quiet and private personality, often feeling more connected to Ireland than the United States. But she has not gone back in many years.

One day, an Irish man comes to her door who she has never met. He knows her name because Tony was a plumber for him and his wife. When Tony was working at their house, he often talked about Eilis. She learns that the Irish man’s wife is pregnant with Tony’s baby. He says he will leave the baby at Eilis’s door when it is born and has no intention of raising it.

Eilis is shocked, confused, and overwhelmed. She sits alone and goes from room to room in their house. She is not sure what to do next, and she begins to question everything about the life she has built.

Tony gets home from his day of work and Eilis manages to avoid him. When it’s time for dinner, Eilis goes through the motions of serving the meal. When Tony begins his usual dinnertime conversation about his day, Eilis lets the stew that she is about to serve him slip off the plate.

# Chapter 2
Every Saturday, Tony’s father would inspect his sons’ cars to see if they were having any problems. Eilis noticed that her father-in-law began to show her more attention when she bought a cheap car. He would always ask her how the car was doing. One day, he finally confessed to Eilis that he had his doubts about her car purchase but acknowledged that it was “turning out to be a bargain.”

If any of the family cars needed fixing, Eilis’s father-in-law sent them to Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D). He owned the best garage and was trusted to fix and work on the cars in Eilis’s family. Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) was known for having the most competitive prices and friendliest service. He was also known to talk a lot about Armenian history.

Eilis also regularly deals with Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) because she manages the accounts for her family business. One day, when visiting the garage, Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) told Eilis that his daughter was getting married and leaving the family business. Eilis and Mr. Dakessian’s (Mr. D’s) daughters both dealt with the bookkeeping for their family’s businesses.

Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D), who is Armenian, also shares a book about Armenian history with Eilis. When she returns to the garage, he tells her that he has a read a book about Ireland. He laments that what happened in Ireland was as bad as what happened in Armenia.

Since his daughter was leaving the family business, Mr. Dakessian (Mr. D) offered a job to Eilis to do their accounts. Eilis took the job without hesitation. She did not consult Tony because she knew he would want her to continue looking after the books for his family.

Eilis had been having difficulty getting her husband and his brothers to agree to her method for accounting. Eilis learns from Frank, one of Tony’s brothers, that the other brothers had been complaining about Eilis. Enzo, Tony’s brother, complained that Eilis was trying to tell them how to run their business.

# Chapter 3
At night, when Eilis and Tony are alone, she finally confronts him about the affair. She asks if the Irish man would really leave the baby at their doorstep. Tony whispers that “He means what he says.”

Finally, she asks Tony if he has had other affairs. Tony says, “Nothing. I told you. I promise you. Just this.”

After this exchange, Eilis distracts herself with work. She senses that Tony is avoiding her and does not want to discuss the affair. Eilis  finally tells Tony her position: She will not take care of the baby, no matter what. Eilis says, “It is your business, not mine.”

In response, Tony asks her what they should do with the baby. He acts very sad. Eilis knows that any sympathy or help will make her position seem weak and too soft. She does not answer him.

Eilis decides to speak to Tony’s brother, Frank. She makes an  appointment to see Frank at his law office in Manhattan.

The summer before, Rosella spent a month working in Frank’s law office. Frank decides to pay for the college tuition of Eilis’ daughter, Rosella, because she is hard-working and it is her dream to go to college. Tony finds out, and is upset that no one consulted him. Tony then says that other family members wonder why Eilis and Frank spend so much time together. Eilis reassures Tony, stating that Frank is “one of those men”. Tony makes Eilis promise not to tell anyone.

Eilis visits Frank in New York City at his law office. She reflects on her mother’s 80th birthday in the summer, wishing she could visit Ireland. She misses her mother and brother, Martin. Her brother, Martin, lives 10 miles from their mother. He visits their mother a few times a week.

When Eilis brings up her previous life in Ireland, Tony and her children do not show any interest.

Eilis tells Frank about the affair and the baby, asking for legal advice. Frank tells her legal action would be difficult and could take time to resolve. Eilis learns that the Irish man has visited Frank’s office. She also learns that Tony and Frank’s father visited Frank’s New York office for the first time.

Frank then reveals what will happen with the baby: Tony’s parents will take care of the baby.

Tony is aware of all of this but has not shared this plan with Eilis. Frank wants Eilish to promise she will not tell anyone what he told her.
