## Chapter 1 - The Ghostwriter
All secrets have a story.
Florence Day is late and has a cactus. Our heroine is unkempt, unstylish, 28 years old, and late. She is supposed to be at Falcon House Publishing as an “assistant” to the author, Ann Nichols, but Florence is actually Ms. Nichols ghostwriter.
At the publishing house, Florence greets Erin, the receptionist, and they talk of drinking last night with Rose, Florence’s roommate. Florence is nervous; she is meeting her new editor and she doesn’t know if he has been told that she was the ghostwriter. The old editor, Tabatha, retired and was one of the only people who knew.
Florence had recently decided that romance is dead and thus, is not
inspired to write romance.
When the new editor comes in he is very imposing. He is very neat, less than 35 years old, well dressed, precise, fit, and hot. They get along until Florence tells him that Ann wants to not have a happy ending. She says “romance is dead. It feels like a con.” Florence feels like a failure. In the last five years, she has been had written three books under Ms. Nichols name and the fourth book is due tomorrow. The publishing house has given three extensions already. Benji, the editor, will not budge on the deadline. The book is due tomorrow.
Ann’s agent, Molly, is very hands off and Florence doesn’t want to
disappoint her.
She has already failed once before.
Florence feels she is going to have a panic attack or cry. As she leaves the building, Florence needs a drink and/or a book with murder in the in text.
## Chapter 2 - The Breakup
Florence could not write romance because of a breakup that shook up her belief in love. One year ago, in April, she left a relationship. She was glad to have left, but she felt disappointed that she felt for the man.
She wrote and deleted it whatever she wrote. She felt betrayed by a genre.
When she was younger, before the ghostwriting, she wrote a book, had a publisher, and the book flopped. She felt betrayed by the publishing field as well as herself.
Now she knows the plot and the characters so well, but she can’t write the end. Her characters have betrayed each other and she can’t get them back together. It’s too close to her story. She’s trying to write a reconciliation scene and she kills a character. Not the romance said she was hoping.
Her brother Carver calls. He is the only one in the family who knows that Florence is a ghostwriter and he keeps guessing who she writes for. Florence will not tell.
Carver and Florence want their father to be checked out by a doctor, but he is too busy. Alice, the youngest daughter who also works in a funeral home with their father, has not pushed the issue.
Florence misses her family.
Her father gets on the phone and teases her about her love life. He is a romantic. He also sees ghosts with Florence.
Florence hides here sight in New York, she sees ghosts, but ignores their stairs. Her father would appalled.
## Chapter 3 - Dead Romance
Florence used to be good at romance. She wants what her parents had. 35 years married happily fighting and loving. Dancing through life together. There is two main characters, Amelia and Jackson, and she needs to write a recollection scene, but her characters are not cooperating (sometimes violently).
Rose Wu, roommate and best friend of Florence, want to go out for drink. Rose uses an emergency word get her to dress pretty and go out on the town.
## Chapter 4 Faded Mates
Florence missed the stars. In New York, the stars do not shine as much as
home.
Rose drags Florence into a sketchy alley and knocks at the door. The door
opens to a quiet yet filled room.
Florence believes that she is not cool enough for this Bohemian atmosphere. She is in a too tight dress, with a too expensive cocktail, everyone else is too cool, and she is just Florence Minerva Day.
It is a literary reading. People snapped instead of clapping; it was that kind
of cool.
Rose picked the perfect place for Florence. She was tired of reaching for the storybook love, the too good to be true, and she was not the exception to the rule.
Nevertheless, she wanted to believe in love, just for the night.
Then he stands up to read. Her ex.
All of her potential happiness deflates.
## Chapter 5 Dead Serious
Florence met Lee Marlowe at a publishing event. She was hiding in the library room, resting her tired feet, when she met Lee. A Meet cute if you ever saw one.
He asked her out and she now wishes she said no. But, she had thought that she had a romance novel happing in real life.
She did not tell him about her ghostwriting because it was not allowed, so she told him all her other secrets. After two years, she told him about her ghosts. She started seeing ghost at eight or nine. Then she looked at Lee and saw him looked skeptical so she started backing out, saying it was a story she was working on. Lee encouraged her to continue. She did.
She should never have told.
Lee said no one remembers romance stories. Lee wrote her stories without her permission. Three years, one day after they met, she found out that she was a main character in his stories. Her family, the funeral home, the bullies, and all of her memories. All of her secrets became fodder for Lee’s book.
He shut her out and then all the truths came out. All of his lies or stories were fiction and now she cannot make stories herself 
## Chapter 6 The Death Toll
Florence had not seen her ex in a year. The feeling of cold water rushed to her. What was she doing? Lee started his reading, “When the Dead Sing”, and he announced that it was coming out in a few months.
She slipped away to compose herself. She needed fresh air so that he would not see her cry. She cried whenever she felt anything that brought a strong emotion. She wanted to yell at the same time as she wanted to run away. As she was leaving she came across Benji, he witnessed her crying.
She felt lost and lonely. When Benji asked if he could help, she kissed him. It helped, but she  would not fall in love with him because love is dead.
They were interrupted by a phone call. Her mother had called to tell Florence that she had to come home. Her father had died from a heart attack.
Florence had a flashback of her father staying up late and he used to “listen to the dead sing”.
She shoved Benji away and when Rose appeared, she told her best friend that her father had died.
## Chapter 7 Days Gone
Days Gone Funeral Home had stood in Mairmont, South Carolina for 100 years. The family, Xavier, Isabel, Florence, Carver, and Alice were all accountants of death. They celebrated death. Respectfully.
Florence could not believe her father was dead. There was so much she not done with him. For the last 10 years, she has not visited the town. When she graduated high school she left for college and didn’t look back. Florence was flooded with guilt. She should have been back sooner, before her father had died. 
Three crows watched from a dead tree. She did not like crows.
Florence was thinking on her past and how she had not been there for them. Alice is not happy to see her and Florence was not thrilled to see the town. As she walked into Days Gone Funeral Home she was inundated with memories. She had lived in the funeral home for 12 years.
Florence and Alice are not getting along, though that was not the case growing up. Carver is there with his boyfriend, Nicki, her mother, Isabelle, hugged her tightly and she saw Seabury, the cemetery caretaker and friend.
Then, it was time to read the will. It read like a list of things he wanted at the funeral: 
One – 1000 wildflowers ( Florence remembered that he used to pick wildflowers for her mother every Saturday).
Two – Elvis was to sing.
Three – the decorations were already ordered.
Four – a murder of 12 crows were to fly above.
Five – Florence was to read a letter without knowing the contents.
A doorbell rings and Florence goes to answer it. It is a shadow, a ghost, and Benji was dead.
## Chapter 8 Death of a Bachelor
Ben was as shocked to see her as she was to see him. She immediately shut the door in his face. Her mother called to her, asking who it was and she said no one. Yet when she opened the door again, there he was. Shimmering and without a shadow, he was definitely dead. He looked as he did yesterday: same shirt, same tie. When she put her hand through him, they both swore.
## Chapter 9 Dead on Arrival
Florence‘s mom called for her again and Ben was disappeared. She was still shocked that Ben, the editor and the man she had kissed yesterday was dead.
Her mom could tell that something was wrong, thinking that it was being back in town. She tried to appease her. Florence didn’t tell her that she almost didn’t come: not only because of the town, but also she didn’t want to face the reality that her dad was dead. 
She referred to herself as the “disaster child” and Carver had to agree. He ended up asking her about the book that she had not finished as they walked into the parlor. Everyone was upset; they had no idea what to do for the funeral. Florence suggested her dad might want an Elvis impersonator… Carver mentioned a spot their dad used to pick flowers… Their mother joked about the crows that hung around the funeral home, but they could figure things out tomorrow.
Mom and Alice lived close to the funeral home.  At one time they had all lived IN the funeral home, but Carver and Alice don’t remember that part of their lives. Florence did and it was because of her that they moved.
A young ghost wanted to see his body. The young boy, about 12 same as Florence, couldn’t believe he was dead, so she showed him. The ghost was appease and left. Florence tried to leave the morgue, but got trapped until morning.
Their mother invited the girls to have a whiskey, they agreed. Florence was looking at the framed pictures and one caught her eyes, the article was, “Local Girl, Solves Murder with Ghosts“, with a picture of a 13 year old Florence.
At the site of the article, she decided to go to a bed-and-breakfast, using the excuse of the book deadline.
Florence felt isolated from her town. She had walked out the day of her graduation and had not been back since. Leaving had cost her Alice’s friendship. She wished had done thing differently.
Everything was catching up to her, including the darn crows.
## Chapter 10 Dead and Breakfast
Florence enters a small bed-and-breakfast, hidden by greenery. Dana, they/them, was at the front desk. Florence knew Dana from high school; they were so much more stylish than she was (then and now). They were surprised to see Florence and then remembered the upcoming funeral. Florence paid the bill until the end of the week. She had just gotten herself out of debt and here she was, getting in debt. again. Still, better that living with family. Asking for the least spooky room, Dana laughed and put her in their favorite room. 
All the second floor rooms were named for deadly flowers. Wolfsbane was her room.
She cautiously entered and found there to be no ghosts.
She emptied her suitcase, and there was a noise, but still no ghosts. 
Florence slept.
## Chapter 11 Past Tense
After not enough sleep (afraid of one ghost in particular) Florence gets ready to meet her family. Seeing John at the desk, she is engulfed in a bear hug. She has not seen him since high school. She congratulations him on his wedding to Dana and he gave her his condolences for her father.
At the diner, the family discussed how they will handing do the two funerals already on the books. Alice and their mom do not want to pass the responsibility to another funeral home. Carver volunteered to be the greeter for the funerals, but no one had time for their father’s plans. So, Florence volunteered to attempt to satisfy the bizarre requests of their father for his funeral. Once her family had left, Florence paid the tab and noticed a stranger talking to himself. It was Benji.
Trying to stop the gossips in a small town, she tried to ignore him, but Ben was insistent. Why was she the only one that could see him? What was going on? He persisted. Florence was frustrated; for ten years she had a successfully ignored her odd talent and now here was Ben, in her hometown as a ghost. She told him that he was a ghost and he didn’t believe her. Most ghosts believed her, but Ben was adamant that he was not a ghost.
Florence punched at him through his chest to prove it.
Ben did not believe in ghosts. How did she see ghosts?
Lee had never asked that question.
She does not know why she can see ghost and she admits that. Then he tells her that she already knew she was not finished with the script. Meaning that he knew that she was a ghostwriter all along.
Ben does not think that she is a failure.
But, Florence believes she is.
Suddenly, Ben hear something and he’s gone.
## Chapter 12 Emotional Support
Rose was relieved to hear from her. Florence started the conversation with complains about her siblings. Alice still hated her and she was so successful, she had gone to Duke for Forensic Chemistry. Carver was very successful in the tech industry and then there is Florence… in her words is an “unequivocal failure”.
And yet she has to plan her father’s funeral.
Rose tried to remind her that she was very good at pulling things together. But Florence is fixated with her failures on the book and she redirect to Rose and her her work drama. Then Rose was talks about Benji Anderson being hit by a car. Florence was shocked. She was not going crazy and it also meant that Ben’s unfinished business has to be with her.
Rose offered to fly out to support, but Florence, though tempted, declined.
Florence has this handled, as always.
## Chapter 13 Ghost Intentions
There was a pattern to the crows. If there was ghost around, the crows were there. That afternoon Ben was there, but he was hiding. 
Florence went to the flower shop. She saw her dad everywhere, in the normal way of memories, and she realized she had written death wrong. All these years it was not a hollow and vast emptiness, but rather it was a heavy and drowning feeling, of not absence of a love one, but it was everything you loved in a tight knot, choking you.
She entered the flower shop and asked about the cost of one thousand flowers. It would cost her one thousand, five hundred dollars. Florence did not have the money and florist did not have that many wildflowers. She thanks him and was going to leave when he asked if there was anything else he could do.  She told him about her father’s wishes and the florist was thought of an Elvis impersonator singer.  Her father love listening to him at Bar None. She thanked him and when he apologized about a delivery that her dad put in but that would be delayed. She offered to deliver it. 
Once she left the flower shop, she told Ben that she could see him and he confessed he didn’t know what to do. So she let him accompany her. She delivered the flowers to a Mrs. Elizabeth, and there was a ghost. She was delivering and anniversary gift from a dead husband. In seeing this, Ben finally realized his was dead. She was a sympathetic crier and she cried when he teared up.  She tried to joke with puns and he joined in and then disappeared again.
## Chapter 14 Moonwalks
She didn’t want help. She was too stubborn.
But, one thousand wildflowers cost was insane. They were weeds! It was driving Florence to drink. Dana stopped by to see if Florence was okay and they both were greeted by the Mayor.
Fetch was a fetching, handsome dog. It had been 10 years since she had last seen him. She crouched down and petted and hugged and was licked in return. Seaburn, Fetch’s owner, was following and stated that every storefront had a dog bowl that was changed daily. He also informed her that he had been kicked out by her mom. She too was stubborn.
He commented on her book, Ardently Yours; he had liked it and loved the happy end.  A great compliment because he was well read. He said that all of Mairmont had also read it and liked it.
He brought up the funeral and how she was doing it all. She felt guilty for leaving, but Seaburn said that Mairmont “ran you out” with all the bullying and ostracizing. It was good to hear.
Florence went to find Fetch and found him with Benji.
She commented that it was a good night for a moonwalk. Requiring a cloudless sky and a graveyard, it is sublime. Ben asked if she wanted to go.  He wants to get to know her and she wants to unburden her secrets to him.
## Chapter 15 the Sorrows of Florence Day
They came upon St. John’s of Mairmont Cemetery. Florence jumps the wall, but Ben is deterred. He doesn’t like to test the law, but Florence teases him. He cannot get in trouble. He is still not comfortable so she offers to go to the park or the ridge. (There is something about ridge, something happened there…)
And Ben is scared of other ghosts!
No one is stirring but for them and if anybody shows up, Florence can sing to scare them off. He chuckles and Ben becomes somber, probably thinking of his predicament.  He wasn’t much older than her and all his plans are gone.
“Live a little,” Florence said. A bad choice of words.
She jumped up and over and he followed, walking through the wall and not liking it. They sat under the sky and he asked if he could ask her about talking to ghosts. She would try to answer his questions.
Does it run in the family? –No, just her dad and her.
Does she exorcist ghosts- No.  She was more of a listener. The ghost just want to tell her stories and she liked listening to them.
Ben asked why she left Mairmont – It was a long story.
When she was 13, she helped a ghost solve its own murder.  Media took her family’s secret and turned into public gossip and the town did not believe her. They thought she was telling her stories, she wrote fiction and this was just another story.
At that subject, Ben told her that he liked her book, the one she published under her own name.
They talked about the stars that don’t come out New York. He was from Maine, so Florence asked if he knew Ann Nichols. He retort with, didn’t she ask if he knew Stephen King? That turned into: Has she ever met a famous ghost?
She had only been real active with the ghosts in Mairmont. She stopped listening to them when she moved to New York.
Than they talked about Lee.  Ben knew him, they were acquaintances, colleagues really and he had not read the book he wrote. She said it wasn’t worth it. She hated main character. She was too apathetic, as if strong women could not be emotional. And a female character did not kiss well. Ben had to disagree there. Florence flushed.
And then she figured it out why he was here! He did have unfinished business, the manuscript!
She just made this realization when the cops came. She didn’t tell the truth to Ben. She had been banned from this graveyard. She had a 10 year old parking ticket and some misdemeanors in Mairmont.
Ben scares the crows and then they get away.
She would help him in his closure, but it would hurt her to say goodbye already.
## Chapter 16 Songs for the Dead
Saturday turns into Sunday and Florence tries to help her mother with the other two funerals. She doesn’t like funerals because they tend to attract ghosts, but she felt obligated. Her mother had no need for Florence.
Making her way downstairs, in order to get her second breakfast (Hobbits had the right idea), she runs into the officer from the cemetery. He asked if she had seen anything last night and she claimed that she had not.  She was pretty sure that he had not gotten a good look at her. She kept denying and finally he gave up; telling her to act her age. The officer might still have an issue about that possum that she brought into the station. It was rabid, but she thought it was dead!
She then asked John if Bar None was open and it was very soon. She could bring the Mayor with her. Florence hopes that her luck would be better with Elvis than it had been with the flowers.
The bartender recognized her instantly.  Small towns, she thought and cringed. She asked her strange question and the bartender acknowledged   that didn’t have an Elvis but did have an Elvis-too! The chef was the singer and came out the back when called.  He said everyone loved her father and he always told stories about Florence and that she was “writing words that could wake the dead”. 
When she told him what he wanted, he was surprised.  On Thursday at three her Dad had requested Elvis to sing for the funeral.  He readily agreed and for free, in honor of her father.
## Chapter 17 Dead Hour
Florence wandered to the cemetery. It was already closed, but she didn’t know where else to go. A storm was coming and Ben appeared. 
He was not as pristine as he usually was and a ring on a chain peaked out. A wedding ring? That bothered her and she didn’t know why.
She can smell the storm and asked if he could accompany her to the inn. He acquiesced and was the way he said her name trilled her. Lee had only called her “bunny”.
He has a different theory as to why she was there. Ben thought he was here to help her. She laughed, but became sobered when he said it was to help her believe in love again. Florence rebuked the idea. Never in all her time as a ghost communicator, had she ever been helped. It was always her helping them.
Florence is happy to have her eyes wide open to love.
She says she will finish the manuscript, but she needs time. Ben said she had that time.
Florence is sad for Ben and she wishes that her father could be there to help her with him. Remember love. She has other things to do.
He asked her about Elvis and she had to chuckle because he was shocked that she found him and his eyes grew big. It was an impersonator, not the real one. Ben was confused, an impersonator at a funeral?
She said he would have understood if he had met her Dad.
They walked past the bookstore. Florence was startled with Lee’s book advertised, she walked past quickly but when Ben saw the bookstore, he wanted to go inside.
Florence was curious as to what his taste was so she followed.  The bookseller recognized Florence and they chatted about the Lee’s book poster.  The bookseller was not excited for the book, but a friend raved about it.  The cover looks like what a city person imagined a rural scene would like. Florence agreed, knowing it was true.
When she found Ben in the aisles she asked him why he switched from horror to romance.  He told her about a book that changed his life. He wanted to make it easier for a writer like that. Great books are read because of publishing companies. Many are overlooked. 
Asked if it was a best seller that changed his life and he said no. The best books are barely know of.  She asked if her book was one of the good ones; it was.
It was gratifying to hear that. Rose was mystified with her need for validation, but she did. Florence admitted she doesn’t know how to end the story.  For the first time since forever, she is curious about someone else’s life story. She wanted to know all about the secrets, she wanted to help a ghost. She asked if he had any messages for her to relay.  He said there was no one in his life, he was alone. All he had was a cat, which was covered in his will. He had a will but he had not thought it would happen this soon. He wanted to fall in love. The thing is she no longer believed it.
That night Florence thought of Ben; she wanted to finish the manuscript for him. 
## Chapter 18 The Undertaker‘s Daughter
It was Monday and it was time for another family meeting at the diner. Florence was amazed at how easily she fell back into the routine with her family, even after 10 years. She was glad to see them after spending a frustrating morning, trying to write. The characters were still estranged, although they hadn’t killed each other yet.  Progress.
Alice was having a frustrating time of it. The wrong make up for the cadavers came in and Alice was out of embalming fluid. Like Florence always wanted to be a writer, Alice always wanted to be a mortician. Alice is well schooled in it.   Attending Dukes forensic chemistry, she also got degrees in Mortuary Sciences and Funeral Services.
Florence felt that Alice should have inherited the gift. Alice was a more take charge sort of person. She tackled problems. Always had.
Alice is ready to fight Florence now, over leaving 10 years ago. Florence saw everybody at Christmas in New York. It was a ritual to come up. Alice says that Dad made them go. Florence looked toward their mother and it was confirmed. 
Everything was coming up: the dead editor, their dad‘s funeral, and her family’s estrangement. She wanted nothing more than take a long, hot shower. She stood there until her mind cleared until Ben popped in her mind, she liked a dead guy. She hadn’t liked anyone since Lee, make was he was safe. The suddenly, he was there! She was naked! She screamed and grabbed the shower curtain. Ben was embarrassed, but managed to quote “Princess Bride”. Putting on her comfy, not sexy, clothes, her phone binged. Alice wanted Florence to write their dad’s obituary.
## Chapter 19 A Dying Practice
As Florence tried to summarize her father’s life, Ben materialized in the middle of the table Florence was using. She was startled and coffee was spilled. She grumbles that he had to stop doing that! Ben was curious, didn’t that happen with other ghosts? But no, other ghosts just hung around until she helped them. They did not appear suddenly, like in her shower, (he said he was embarrassed about that, but she didn’t that was true).
She took out her phone so she could fake talk to him without causing a seen. She asked what happed in between visits.  Ben didn’t remember. He peered into her screen and asked if it was her script. She was writing her dad’s obituary. Her father used to be great at writing obituaries. She was not.
Tears welled up.
## Chapter 20 Novel Idea
Florence texted Alice to inform her how dismal she is doing with the obituary and Alice let her know that it has to be done by Wednesday. 
Another deadline.
Unable to focus, Florence googled Ben’s name and was surprised at the lack of information as to his recent death. There was nothing. He did have social media page that was not current. As she was snooping, Ben appeared. He was curious about his funeral as well.  He wasn’t worried at the lack. His ex-fiancé would take care of that.
Florence was interested in that story. How the ex-fiancé became an ex. She cheated on him, Ben said.  It was partially his fault because he always working… Florence was bewildered at his defense of her. The ex-fiancé had cheated on him. It was her fault. She should communicated her dissatisfaction before she cheated! But Ben still felt guilty at not being good enough.
Is anger, Florence called Ben an idiot. She was amazed that he believed in love, but not for himself.
Frustrated, she paced in her room. Carver texted to hang out and wash some graves. She was so mad, she might as well be useful.
Meeting with Carver and Nicki, she was still in a bad mood.  Seeing the couple’s love didn’t help, physical work did. They each chose a grave and started cleaning.
After a while, Carver reminisced about running around the graves as children. Alice was protective of her big sister. Florence thought of when they were inseparable. Now they have grown father apart, physical and emotionally.
She never felt that she would be in New York for long. Nowhere seemed permanent. When Rose and Lee as her support, she felt tethered: safe and comfortable. Without that, she felt adrift. 
Carver said that it would be great if she would to come home, but only if she wanted to. Not because she felt obligated.  Unsure of her own emotions, she just wanted to clean some more graves.
Carver joked about her getting the officer antsy already. She told him about the other night’s moonwalk and he was bummed to have missed it. Then he asked how the obituary was going and she excused there herself. She was back at the bed and breakfast to write.
She took her laptop and settled at the bar to start the obituary again.  After writing too many words for an obituary, she switched to the novel.  She remembered the last time she closed the file with the entire novel. It was the beginning of the end. It was when she was writing this story that she paused, curious at Lee’s story. She glanced at it.  When Lee came back she asked him if it was about her. He said it was inspired by her, but it’s not her story.  Semantics. 
How could she write about the characters, Amelia and Jackson, trusting each other, when her could not. Could she write about a character who always knew what she wanted and the world (Amelia) and a weary musician with a heart of gold (Jackson)?  Florence had to try. After a few lines Ben startled her again. He thought she was writing the obituary and was surprised to see her writing the novel. 
He called her “darling”.
He apologized for snapping at her earlier and she reciprocated. He said it felt good to hear that it wasn’t his fault, even though he still thought so. She hoped he would change his mind, eventually.
He said that he would help her with the story, but she can’t understand love and that was the problem. It had been a sting of bad relationship before Lee and adamantly, she might be a problem.
Ben has an idea. He wants to meet her in the town square at noon, no explanation, and left.
## Chapter 21 The Crime Scene
Florence couldn’t sleep. Between sadness for her dad and curiosity about Ben’s surprise, it is no wonder. Her best times as a writer was 10pm-5am, but she wasn’t writing. She was wondering what Ben was thinking. Could he fix her? Then she felt shallow; thinking about her anything other than her dad. Ben distracted her though, thinking of her dad hurt too much.
Every time she saw Ben, he was more disheveled.  And she was ten minutes late, which he noted.
Ben wants her to watch people and imagine their lives. He went first. He imagined that the couple in the park had been matched multiple times on a dating append, but they were out today without the app. Then it was Florence’s turn. She spun a tale of an editor and an author, but she was distracted by seeing her sister.  She had errands to run. Ben disappears.
## Chapter 22 Grave Matters
Florence was still thinking of Ben when as she went to Unlimited Party. Ghosts never stayed, they could not, so she had to focus. On her father’s funeral plans. On her way via Uber, she texted Rose. Rose, being her best friend, asked what was going on with the funeral arrangements. Hearing about the Elvis, Rose chucked.  She said that Florence had a rad dad.  She wanted to tell Rose about Ben and how he helped by distracting her. She did not.
She gets to the store and the clerk looked befuddled at the amount of preorder décor.  He asked if they could deliver it on Thursday. She said that was perfect and rushed out because Alice needed her, now.
Everyone’s gathered in the funeral home, suspiciously like everyone else was invited but her. Carver said it was because she was not part of the family business anymore. Hadn’t been for ten years.
Florence treaded down to the basement where the mortuary was. Alice was frustrated at how long it took her to come. She defended herself with her errands and she looked at her father. Alice wanted to be sure she got make up right. Wanting it to be perfect. The sisters we’re on the same page for a second and then Florence mentioned the obituary. Everything deteriorated after that.
Carver says that after the funeral, the sisters need to talk. Being the brother, middle sibling, and voice of reason - she had to agree. 
She asked her mom how the other two funerals went and her mom said they went well. After Thursday’s funeral, the family were going to close for the rest of the week. It surprised Florence, they never close before.
Her mom couldn’t see her husband, but she felt him.
She heard him in the wind.
## Chapter 23 The Casket of True Love
Ben found Florence crying, again. She missed her dad and was still afraid of letting anyone in. Even Ben. He could not fix this. She was always guarded, but this time she decided to try being open.
So she told him everything. Her father’s quirks and idiosyncrasies, her parents dancing, really everything - he was the one who gave her the idea of writing (the “smut” from the intro).
Then she asked about himself.
He always wanted to be an editor- not to create stories. Ann Nichols was his first romance novel. As an adult, he was always chasing the idea of romance. And then he met Florence. He was surprised by her.
The wind gusted and at his jump, she said it was the dead singing. He recognized Lee’s title and asked about him. She had thought that Lee was IT. She had been close to telling him everything. But, because she could not, she told him stories.
Ben called Lee a bastard.
He was mad in her defense. She laughed joyfully. She felt herded by Ben. She wished she had met him earlier; Ben felt the same.
## Charter 24 Such a Scream
Florence’s mother came home and Florence rushed to get off the floor, looking back at Ben, who has disappeared. She had startled her mother who was also surprised her; it had been a short dinner. Her mom asked Florence to walk her home. Her mom said that she was glad to see her eldest daughter. The reason was unfortunate, but it was her husband’s style.
They talked about the past, dad and Florence. Her mom hated the town for running her out. She was a 13-year-old girl helping someone and the town ostracized her. The body was found in the ridge. She brought the police there because the dead boy insisted on it.  She did not lie about how she knew and she was shunned.
Her mom and her had a way of joking that was dark (Lee hated her it, of course).  Oh how she missed her family.
She missed the slow nature if the town as well. New York was always changing. At first, she had loved everything new in New York. You could meet new people every minute. Nobody fit in a box in New York, no collective mind, and she had loved it. Then there while Lee.
Dad had suspected that she would not always be happy in New York.
For the last year, she had been keeping her family at arm’s length because she was ashamed. All her secrets were put on display in Lee’s book, theirs too.
She decided to tell her mom about Lee’s book. About her memories becoming fodder for money and fame.  She said that she thinks the worst thing was that Lee had written dad wrong. He was not weird or terrifying or cryptic – that dad had been immortalized wrong. 
Her mom‘s response was in a four letter word.  Mom said, “We are not a Gothic horror novel, we are a love story” and Florence had to agreed. There was nothing but love in those memories. Lee was the one who didn’t understand love.
Her mom knew that she would write her parent story. Maybe not at once, but it will be there in pieces.
Ben appeared just as her mom was closing her door. He worried about her catching a cold. She asked him if he ever done anything rebellious.  She thinks that it went better for him, following the rules, if she were an example. He respond with the fact that he was dead.
She asked him if he wanted to scream and he replied that he did. She told him to do it. He screamed and screamed and then she joined him. 
They both felt little better.
## Chapter 25 Deadweight
A drowned rat approached the bed-and-breakfast. Florence was the drowned rat. She felt better after screaming with Ben. Almost felt OK. She thanked Ben when she was out of the rain and noticed the tattoo on his forearm was exposed, it had numbers.
Florence really wished that Ben was not dead. She had felt this way for another ghost, the one that she found dead at the ridge. She had let that ghost get too close. She couldn’t let that happen again. 
Dana was in the bed-and breakfast and grabbed a towel for Florence. All of a sudden, she ran into a bully from her past. 
Heather Griffin.
Heather was part of the book club and there was a meeting going on. They were reading an Ann Nickels book, one that Florence had actually penned. Heather was being belittling, just like in high school.
Dana interjected, trying to silence Heather.
Dana commiserates with Florence. She told Dana about the flowers she was looking for and the obituary that she had to write.  They mentioned that the ridge was a possibility. The ridge. Florence did not want to go there, but she would.
Heather and the book club were talking about Ann Nichols and how much they love her. Florence got the courage to face her bully and said that she knew that Heather didn’t like her and that she spread those rumors in high school, but Florence forgave her. What she had realized was that she did a good thing, finding Harry. She couldn’t control how someone treated her but, she could control how she acted and thought.
In her room she explained to Ben that Harry was the person that she had helped when she was 13. Harry didn’t know why he had died so she had to find him physically. She had like Harry.
Ben wished a good night and Florence wondered if he went at night. She asked and found that he just wandered the town.
She realized that she was falling in love with Ben.
Trying to focus, she decided to try taking her mom advice. She started a simple story. She started with goodbye.
## Chapter 26 Which of the Past
Florence was not a nature lover, not even a nature liker. She was climbing to the ridge to get those flowers and nature was attacking her. She hadn’t been back to the ridge for two reasons: nature and memories.
She wanted to see Ben, but she didn’t see him all the way up. She hasn’t seen him with her family at the waffle house. Now, walking the trail she was alone. At the top, was a bench to commemorate Harry. 
Ben appeared. Making a comment on her shoe choice. 
Harry had been killed by his father and the speedy finding of the corpse had helped. The father was still in prison.
Florence found only o’clocks or dandelions, a wildflower but not what she was looking for.
As they lay in a field of dandelions, they resumed the editor and chaotic author storyline. Ben believed in her, even though she does not. What would she wish for?
She would wish what she could not be said aloud. She realized that love isn’t dead, but it also wasn't forever.
She waited for Ben to say his wish but,when a gust of wind blew, he was gone.
## Chapter 27 Ghost of a Chance
At the bottom of the ridge, Florence found Carver. He was carting a carved birdcage. He thinks he has a plan for the funeral birds. He wants to catch 12 crows (which should be easy because the birds have been stealing the squirrel food) and release them during the ceremony.
If it succeeds, that will be a murder of crows ready to murder!
He complimented her on the obituary. He also complemented her handling of Heather the day before and how Florence and Mom talked about feeling excluded. This town! So much gossip! Caver apologized for the latter. He thought that Florence would be overwhelmed with the family business, dad, the town, and her ‘sight’. 
She had been seen talking to air!
She asked if he thought their dad was crazy as well. He had never thought she or dad were crazy.
He did say she was isolating herself, though.
That hit too close.  She has had enough and let herself out of his truck. She was angry and scared that someone had seen her talk to Ben and the rumor mail was starting.
Ghost whisperer.
But she was reminded of the dandelions and she was OK.
## Chapter 28 Dancing with the Dead
It was time for the wake. Walking from Main Street, Florence saw the entire town approach the Days Gone Funeral Home. Each person brought food.
For over an hour, the town had closed their doors to attend. Everyone was outside, and Florence went inside to prepare. She saw wildflowers separated by colors and Florence was baffled.
Heather was there wanting to help. She wanted to show that she had changed since high school. Dana helped, knowing that flowers were needed.
Florence didn’t know what to think. Was this real, genuine, kindness or was there a motive behind it. No, she was being paranoid and just thanked Heather.
All the siblings clasped each other’s hands. How to say goodbye?
Everybody in the town gave their condolences. The siblings held hands to hold back their tears.
Even Mrs. Elizabeth came along, with her dead husband trailing along.
When the last mourner left, Florence heard Ben’s voice. She felt better instantly. He wasn’t sure how long he had been. He was surprised that he missed the wake. He had wanted to help her.  He wanted to hug her and tell her everything will be OK. Florence asked him that it was true. Did it get better after time?
He had lost his parents in a car accident when he was 13. His grandmother adopted him. His grandmother encouraged him to wear the ring on a chain to remember his dad‘s love. It helped.
Ben gave his condolences; she replied, “You’ve been really great” and laughed.  “Ben” and “been” had them both throwing puns back and forth. 
She laughingly told Ben that he must have wished that he would never let her leave the office that day. He said yes, more sober. 
As Carver breezed by, Florence asked for help. Both siblings were surprised and glad to help. 
They scattered when their mom called. 
Ben asked if Lee ever got anything right in the book. Lee thought her childhood was tragic.  It wasn’t tragic, sad or lonely. It was good.
She took out the CDs and found “Good Goodbyes” in her dad‘s handwriting. She offered to play with Ben. The music was light and happy and brought the family in from wherever they were. 
The Days danced.  Florence wanted to pretend with Ben. She held her hand out and they danced.
She was happy.
## Chapter 29 When the Dead Sing
The family was gathered together playing a game of spades. Ben was far enough away, after causing Nicki to shiver. Florence was determined not to lose  as the loser had to do the dishes. 
Ben watched the family dynamic. And Florence watched Ben.  She couldn’t help but know that her father would have like Ben.
Her siblings were picking on her whispering to her ghost friend and Florence then cheated. Just for the teasing. Ben and Florence won 5 games and she was not good at the game.  Her mom asked if her ghost friend was there. Florence said he was and his name was Ben.  Her family told her not to cheat, but to keep playing with Ben (he was a better player).  The family was nonplussed at a ghost. Her mom said that was why her dad was so good at cards!
Ben tried to help her, but Florence still got stuck with the dishes.
Florence and her mother talked about dad and the gift of speaking to dead. Florence admitted that any of the other siblings would have been a better medium. Her mother said that each one had strengths and weaknesses.
Florence then wondered about the letter that she would have to read and why her? Her mother thought it might be simply that she was the one that needed it the most.
Alice ended up helping Florence the dish. Florence apologized for leaving. Alice reviled that it was not the leaving that she was made of. She wished Florence had taken her to New York at first. Then she was mad because Florence and their dad were still close. Alice and Florence have drifted. Florence had a special bond with her dad and Alice was jealous. 
Then Alice started to cry, which she never did. She thought if Florence was here and not Alice, he would have gone to the doctor and he wouldn’t be dead. Florence said that was not true. That was not her fault. It was their father’s. After the tears, Alice told her to go.
As she left, she saw Ben more relaxed than he had ever been in life. She was amazed that she saw a ghost change. His beard grew, his posture relaxed, and he became more disheveled. 
Ben walked her home. Both are exhausted, but Ben knows she’ll get through it and somehow he will too. As she put the key in the lock, Ben said he liked her family. He got to see them for the whole week, dealing with the grief. 
Suddenly, Ben became pale and almost staggered against the wall. He started hearing voices.
He insisted that he’s fine, but it is nothing. He is dead, so what is the worst that could happen. He can hear his heartbeat growing weaker. He said doesn’t believe it was the book that was drawing them together. Doesn’t want it to be, because it means that if they finished the book, than he will be gone.
She wanted him to stay as well. He was pale so she told him to stay.  
Ben stayed.
## Chapter 30 Strange Bedfellows
It was Thursday, Florence's father's funeral, and Ben was in her bed. He was still there, he did not disappear. It looked like he was sleeping, but the ghost didn't sleep or breathe. There were circles under his eyes.
Both said their good mornings and Florence admitted that she was dreading the funeral. Ben said he would be that for her. It helps her, just being around him. The same was true for him. He feels seen, and not just because he is a ghost.
She feels that she is failing him with the book.
He only wished he had kissed her that first day, after asking her permission to kiss her first, of course. He had thought she hated him.
That was far from the truth.
He had gone to the party at which Florence met Lee. Ben remembered her. He wanted to meet her, but he was in a new relationship. He had just started dating his ex. Then Lee came in and introduced himself to Florence.
She wish that she met Ben instead. He said it would have been terrible for her at that time. He was an over achiever and a workaholic. That was why his ex-fiancé had cheated on him. Florence said it was not his fault and he started to believe her.  He wondered why he couldn’t tell himself that, but he believed her. She said it was because she was “rarely wrong” he reminded her that she did say that romance was dead… and she said, “aren’t you?”
He asked how she met Ann Nichols. It was in a coffee house. She had just dumped her agent, after her publisher dropped her. She was writing some saucy “smut” and Ann critiqued the work and offered her a job. That was 5 years ago.
Ann and Florence had argued about grand gestures and eloquent wording. Florence was pro all of that. People needed corny. Like this, Ben and Florence. Wanting to touch, but unable to.
They proved their point… Ben said set the scene and the alarm went off.  Funeral time.
