### Summary
1. The book starts out in September 1991 in New Jersey. Bill Nagle waits for a fisherman to give him information on how to find a shipwreck. Bill was 40-years-old in 1991. 
1. Bill was the captain of the "Seeker," a charter diving boat that he operated from Brielle, New Jersey. Bill built the Seeker to take divers to the most dangerous wrecks in the Atlantic Ocean. 
1. When Bill was in his 20s, he became a legend of diving shipwrecks. In the 1970s and 1980s, shipwreck diving was a new sport. The equipment had changed very little since it was invented in the 1940s. 
1. Bill was a diver who always pushed the limits. He preferred undiscovered wrecks and regularly dove below 200 feet deep. 
1. Bill had spent some time diving the popular wreck the "Andrea Doria." This is a shipwreck from 1956. Many men have died while exploring this wreck. 
1. Bill’s goal was to recover the bell of the Andrea Doria. Bill bought a dive boat (the original Seeker), recruited five divers, and successfully discovered the bell. 
1. After this, Bill decided to open a charter business. By 1991, Bill was endangering his business by excessive drinking. He spent much of his time at a bar called the Harbor Inn (aka the Horrible Inn). 
1. Since shipwrecks were common places to find fish, many wrecks were discovered by fishing boat captains. These captains kept the wreck locations secret from competitors. 
1. The fishing captains would write the coordinates of the sites in a private journal. Shipwreck divers would also keep the location of wrecks a secret. 
1. Occasionally, divers and fishermen would trade numbers. This is what Bill was waiting to do at the beginning of the chapter. 
1. Bill met a fishing captain named Skeets at the Harbor Inn. Skeets told Bill about a spot 60 miles offshore. There seemed to be a very large object over 200 feet deep here. 
1. Skeets offered to trade the coordinates for the spot in exchange for a wreck he knew Bill could locate. Skeets warned Bill that his site is in a very dangerous place with strong currents. This did not worry Bill. 
1. Bill contacted John Chatterton. Bill had met John years ago during a charter trip to the Texas Tower. A man died on this trip, and John offered to retrieve the body. Bill respected John after this. 
1. Bill asked John if he wanted to help explore the mystery wreck. Bill and John enlisted twelve more divers willing to cover expenses. 
1. On September 2nd, 1991, the divers headed toward the coordinates of the mystery wreck.

### Summary
1. Deep sea divers encounter extreme dangers. Deep sea diving is a very different sport from recreational scuba diving. Most deep sea divers come close to dying, watch another diver die, or die themselves. 
1. Deep sea divers experience nitrogen narcosis. This condition happens below 66 feet and worsens as the depth increases. 
1. Nitrogen narcosis is caused by nitrogen accumulating in the bloodstream due to high underwater pressure. Nitrogen narcosis causes impaired motor skills, reduced peripheral vision, slowed thinking processes, and hallucinations. 
1. The other major danger of deep sea diving is decompression sickness. This is also known as “the bends”. This condition occurs when a diver tries to ascend too quickly. 
1. With decompression sickness, large nitrogen bubbles press onto a diver’s tissues. This causes extreme pain, paralysis, or even death. 
1. To avoid decompression sickness, a diver needs to ascend slowly. The diver should stop at predetermined depths and wait for the nitrogen to naturally release from his body. 
1. Atlantic deep sea divers reach shipwrecks by charter boats. These trips are often all-day or overnight. Keys to a successful dive include good planning and reliable diving equipment. 
1. There are many challenges to deep sea diving. One challenge includes actually getting to and from the shipwreck safely. 
1. When a charter boat arrives at a dive site, the mates drop the anchor on the shipwreck. The mates dive down to ensure the anchor is securely attached to the shipwreck. 
1. The anchor line is crucial to shipwreck diving. It provides a guide for divers to find the wreck and their way back to the charter boat. 
1. If a diver loses sight of the anchor line, the undersea currents can carry him miles away. These divers are usually lost to the sea. 
1. Most times, divers descend to the shipwreck alone. There is no buddy system in deep sea diving. It can be dangerous to help a diver in trouble as he might struggle and injure another diver. 
1. It takes just a few minutes to reach a 200-foot-deep shipwreck. Once a diver reaches the wreck, he has about 25 minutes to explore. 
1. Most divers stay outside of the wreck. The inside of a shipwreck is dangerous and difficult to navigate. A diver can become tangled in wires or blocked by furniture. 
1. If a diver becomes lost inside a wreck, he is in grave danger. He could run out of air and drown. 
1. There is poor visibility at a shipwreck. Silt, oil, and air bubbles make it difficult to see. This is known as “zero viz” or zero visibility. 
1. In 1988, a skilled diver named Joe Drodz took a trip to the Andrea Doria wreck aboard the Seeker. Joe brought a third air tank just to be safe. 
1. Joe and two partners entered the inside of the Andrea Doria wreck. Joe became tangled in a line and panicked. He experienced worsening narcosis and thought he ran out of air. 
1. Joe’s partners tried to help him. Joe panicked so bad that one partner lost his grip on Joe. At first, this partner quickly rose to the surface without decompressing and with no anchor line in sight. He was eventually able to slow his ascent and spot the anchor line. 
1. The second partner also survived. Joe died with a full tank of air. 
1. When a diver ascends and reaches the charter boat, he must climb a ladder attached to the back of the boat. 
1. In 2000, a diver named George Place reached for the ladder in rough seas. George lost his grip on the ladder and drifted away. 
1. The captain Howard Klein took his Zodiac boat to find George. Howard’s motor died so his team placed a Mayday alert. Another fishing boat found George alive. Howard made it back safely too. This incident made Howard and his team believe in miracles.

### Summary
1. The trip to the possible wreck site was six hours from Brielle. The crew included Bill Nagle, John Chatteron, and twelve other divers. The twelve divers made themselves comfortable and bunkered down for the trip. 
1. When the Seeker reached the site coordinates, Bill drove back and forth over the site. The mystery object was deeper than anyone thought: about 230 feet deep. Most divers were not experienced in diving this deep. 
1. Bill and John came up with a plan. John agreed to make the first dive and examine the wreck. If it looked diveable, he would send up a single styrofoam cup. If it was not worth diving, he would release two cups. 
1. John descended to the wreck. He decided the wreck was diveable, so he released one styrofoam cup as a signal. The divers were excited when John signaled the wreck was worth diving. 
1. At first, John thought the wreck was a pipe barge. He looked more closely at the pipes and realized they were actually torpedoes. John determined the wreck was a German submarine from World War II. 
1. After 25 minutes, John started to ascend to the surface. One diver, Kevin Brennan, dove down to where John was decompressing. John wrote “SUB” on a writing slate for Kevin. Kevin rushed to the surface to inform the other divers they found a submarine. 
1. The divers were very excited about exploring an undiscovered submarine. Their initial dive provided no clues about the identity of the sub. Most divers were convinced it was a German U-boat from World War II. 
1. Bill and the other divers swore to keep the submarine a secret. Bill especially wanted to keep the wreck a secret from his rival, Steve Bielenda. Bill and Steve had despised each other for years. 
1. However, the secret did not last...
  1. Bill shared the secret with Danny Crowell, one of his crew members who was not on the Seeker that day. 
  1. Kevin Brennan shared the secret with Richie Kohler, his close friend and fellow diver. Richie decided he had to be on the next trip to the wreck. The next trip was scheduled in two weeks. 
1. Word soon spread that a German U-boat had been discovered. Bill and the other divers tried to downplay this as rumors. 
1. Meanwhile, several of the divers did research to identify the U-boat. The divers decided the U-boat had to be one of two boats: 
  1. U-550: Sunk in April 1944; 100 miles north from mystery wreck b. U-521: Sunk in June 1943; 120 miles south from mystery wreck 12.John Chatterton insists the mystery U-boat is neither of these boats.

### Summary
1. The Seeker was unable to return to the wreck right away due to hurricane season. Instead, John Chatterton and Richie Kohler (separately) researched the possible identity of the U-boat.
1. Richie learned to search the boots on the wreck. The boots could contain the names and belongings of German soldiers.
1. Richie also contacted a retired U-boat commander, Herbert Werner. However, Herbert was not interested in helping Richie.
1. John and Bill worried that Steve Bielenda would try to claim discovery of the wreck. John and Bill decided to issue a press release announcing their discovery of the wreck.
1. A local reporter contacted John and Bill. The reporter wrote a front-page story about the discovery. This story unleashed a media frenzy.
1. People began contacting John with information and stories about the mystery U-boat. Many of these stories were complete bogus.
1. John received a letter from a man named Dieter Leonhard, a captain in the German navy. Dieter claimed the submarine is German property and exploring the wreck is prohibited. John told Dieter he would continue exploring the wreck but promised to be respectful of the human remains.
1. John received a few promising leads:
  1. Harry Cooper - founder of Sharkhunters International, a club dedicated to preserving U-boat history. Harry told John to look for saddle tanks and torpedo tubes on the U-boat. This information could help John identify the type of U- boat.
  1. An unknown man called claiming to have sunk the U-boat from a blimp in 1942.
  1. Experts at the Naval Weapons Station advised John that the U-boat damage was caused by a direct torpedo hit.
  1. A historian named Gregory Weidenfeld claimed the Civil Air Patrol sank the mystery U-boat in July 1942 near New Jersey.
1. Then John received one of the most promising leads:
  1. A man put John in touch with a former U-boat commander, Karl-Friedrich Merten. Karl suggested the mystery U-boat belonged to a commander he personally knew, Hannes Weingartner.
  1. Karl believed that Hannes took the U-boat to the American coast against orders. Hannes’ sub was U-851, and it was never found.
1. Meanwhile, Steve Bielenda had secured the location of the U-boat wreck site. Steve planned a trip to the site to recover Steve Feldman’s body. John believed this was just a cover-up for diving the wreck itself. Steve and his divers did not find the body or identify the wreck.
1. On November 6, 1991, Bill took his crew on a trip to the U-boat. John planned to videotape parts of the wreck. John was allowed to dive first to have the best visibility. This made Richie angry. Richie wanted to dive first to search for artifacts.
1. On John’s first dive, he noted the U-boat had no saddle tanks. This meant the submarine was NOT a Type VII sub. He also found human remains inside the wreck. He was careful not to disturb the remains.
1. On Richie’s first dive, he noticed two torpedo tubes. This meant the submarine was most likely a Type IX sub. Richie found a metal tag and escape lung (pictured on right). He also found human remains on both dives. He decided not to disturb the remains.
1. On John’s second dive, he found a drawer of silverware. Inside was a knife with the name “Horenburg” carved into the handle. John was confident that this name would lead to identication of the U-boat.
1. On the way back to New Jersey, John and Richie made up and agreed to put the past behind them. John agreed to share information and a copy of some videotapes he made.

### Summary
1. Now that John Chatterton had the name of Horenburg, he believed he would identify the U-boat soon. John wrote four U-boat experts about Horenburg. He waited for a response for two months.
1. Then John received an unusual phone call from a U-boat enthusiast. The man told John that Horenburg was still alive. Horenburg did not serve on the mystery U-boat. *This information later turned out to be incorrect.
1. John received replies from three of the U-boat experts. The experts indicated there was only one Horenburg who served in the German navy. Martin Horenburg died on U-869, a U-boat sunk near Africa in 1945.
1. This information frustrated John. He wondered if there was another Horenburg the U-boat experts missed. He planned a trip to Germany to visit a U-boat memorial.
1. Meanwhile, John received a phone call from a man named Gordon Vaeth. Gordon was an American intelligence officer during WWII. Gordon invited John to Washington D.C. to find answers about the U-boat.
1. John met Gordon at the Naval Historical Center in D.C. Gordon introduced John to Bernard Cavalcante and Dr. Dean Allard. Bernard and Dean had access to everything the United States knew about U-boats.
1. John gave the men the location coordinates of the U-boat. The men had no record of a submarine sunk near that location. John showed the men video footage of the mystery U-boat. The men were intrigued.
1. The men wanted to help John identify the U-boat. They gave John access to their records, including files from the US Navy and German records seized after the war. John searched every record but found no answers.
1. John went to Germany with fellow diver John Yurga. They visited the U-boat memorial. They searched the names of the U-boat veterans and found only one Horenburg. Horenburg was listed as the crew of U-869.
1. Next, the two Johns visited the U-boat archives owned by U-boat veteran Horst Bredow. They found no answers to the U-boat’s identity. John C. sent Richie a postcard saying they needed to return to the wreck.
1. Back in the United States, John C., John Y., and Richie searched through thousands of files. The men narrowed down the U-boat’s identity to two possibilities: U-158 or U-851. Both of these were a “Type IX” submarine, which the divers determined was the same type as the mystery sub.
1. U-158 was reportedly damaged and sunk near Bermuda. No debris was ever located. U-158 was never found. Richie believed U-158 could have traveled partially damaged up the East coast before sinking.
1. U-851 had orders to go to the Indian Ocean. John believed its commander Hannes Weingartner may have taken U-851 to New York against orders.
1. John Yurga found a way to determine whether the mystery wreck was U-158 or U-851. U-158 had a deck gun, but U-851 did not. Also, U-851 was about 30 feet longer than other Type IX subs.
1. The men decided to look for a deck gun and measure the wreck on their next dive. This would hopefully determine the identity of the mystery sub.

### Summary
1. The men prepared for their next trip to the U-boat. The trip was planned for May 1992. They believed they would identify the mystery sub soon.
1. In preparation for the trip, John C and John Y experimented with a new diving technology called trimix. Trimix was a method of replacing some nitrogen in diver tanks with helium. Trimix was supposed to reduce problems related to nitrogen narcosis and decompression.
1. No one had ever used trimix at such great depths or in cold water. Richie believed trimix was too experimental and refused to use it. John C and John Y planned to use trimix while diving the mystery wreck.
1. Meanwhile, a fishing boat discovered Steve Feldman’s body. Steve’s body was recovered just five miles from the mystery U-boat.
1. On May 23, 1992, the divers began the season’s first trip to the wreck. Bill was in poor condition from drinking heavily during the off-season.
1. The divers planned to look for a deck gun and measure the wreck’s length. This would help determine whether the sub was U-851 or U-158. However,the trip was cut short.
1. A diver named Lew Kohl forgot to adjust his buoyancy when he entered the water. This caused him to sink very quickly to the bottom. Then, Lew panicked and shot to the surface, risking a case of the bends.
1. Bill called a Coast Guard chopper to evacuate Lew. Lew survived, but declined to return for another dive to the U-boat.
1. The next trip to the mystery wreck was in June 1992. A father and son duo named Chris and Chrissy Rouse joined the dive. They were excellent divers. They also argued a lot.
1. The divers looked for a deck gun and measured the wreck’s length. The wreck was too short to be U-851. Additionally, there was no deck gun which ruled out U-158. The wreck was NOT U-851 or U-158.
1. Before the next dive, John C and Richie discussed the protocol for dealing with human remains. They agreed to never disturb human remains, even if it meant they would never identify the wreck.
1. The final dive of the season was in October 1992. The divers stayed for two days. On day one, John recovered a piece of aluminum engraved with technical diagrams. Two important clues were written on the aluminum:
  1. Deschimag, Bremen - referred to the construction yard where the U-boat was built
  1. Bauart IXC - indicated the type of U-boat (Type IXC)
1. On day two, the divers had bad weather. At first, Chrissy Rouse did not want to dive because of the weather. His dad Chris jokingly pressured him into diving anyways.
1. Chrissy tried to retrieve a piece of fabric with German writing from the wreck. Chrissy became trapped by a steel cabinet. His father Chris helped free him.
1. Once outside the wreck, Chris and Chrissy became disoriented. They could not locate their extra air tanks. Chrissy panicked and shot to the surface. His father Chris followed him.
1. Chris and Chrissy managed to catch the anchor line at 100 feet. Chris tried to give his son some air, but a hose tore and Chrissy could not breathe. Both men rapidly returned to the surface.
1. On the Seeker, Chrissy screamed in pain from the bends. Barb Lander, a nurse onboard, gave Chrissy oxygen and helped calm him. Meanwhile, Chrissy’s father Chris went unconscious.
1. A Coast Guard chopper arrived to evacuate the two men. However, Chris had already died. Later that night, Chrissy died in the recompression chamber.

### Chapter 10 Summary: History Mauled
1. John and Richie traveled to Washington D.C. to continue their research. They narrowed the mystery wreck to two possibilities: U-857 and U-879.
1. Both U-857 and U-879 were docked in Norway at the same time as U-869 (Horenburg’s sub). This offered an explanation for why Horenburg’s knife was on the mystery wreck. Horenburg might have lost his knife or given it to another sailor while the subs were in Norway together.
1. John and Richie compared historical records of what happened to U-857. They discovered that the records contradicted one another.
1. One record classified U-857 as “probably slightly damaged” near Boston. Later, postwar assessors changed U-857’s status to “probably sunk” (even though there was no evidence to prove this).
1. When U-boats could not be accounted for, postwar assessors stretched for any explanation. They did not want to leave any subs unaccounted for.
1. John and Richie theorized that U-857 continued down the East Coast and sank off New Jersey. They believed U-857 was their mystery wreck.
1. John and Richie presented their new theory to experts. The experts were Robert Coppock, Horst Bredow, and Charlie Grutzemacher. The experts all believed the mystery sub could be U-857.
1. Next, John and Richie speculated how the mystery wreck was sunk. Experts believed the wreck was possibly destroyed by its own torpedo. John and Richie imagined what it would be like to be on that U-boat.
1. John and Richie spent the remaining off-season learning about the late U-boat war (1944 - 1945). By then, the Allies used convoys, radar, and sonar to destroy U-boats. It became very difficult for U-boats to survive. John and Richie wondered how these men could have kept fighting.
### Chapter 11 Summary: A Missed Signal
1. In May 1993, John, Richie, and the other divers returned to the wreck. By now, Richie agreed to use trimix. Meanwhile, Bill was in horrible condition from drinking.
1. The divers retrieved more artifacts including a boot, signal flare, and escape lung. None of the artifacts identified the U-boat.
1. John stored the escape lung in his garage. A few days later, the oxygen tank on the escape lung exploded. John noticed April 1944 stamped on the tank. This meant the mystery U-boat sailed after this date.
1. The Seeker made several more trips to the U-boat in 1993. The divers recovered more artifacts. Still, none of these artifacts identified the wreck. When John started to give up hope, Richie said to keep going.
1. Bill’s health continued to decline. He went to the hospital for internal bleeding. When he was released, he drank a bottle of vodka and died.
1. John and Richie started to have marital problems. John and his wife Kathy became distant but stayed together. Richie and his wife Felicia separated.
1. In 1994, Robert Coppock, the British U-boat expert, sent John and Richie a letter. The letter was about U-869, Horenburg’s sub. Robert wrote that U-869 was originally ordered to patrol the East coast off New York.
1. Later, U-869 was directed to go to Gibraltar (a British territory near Africa). However, Robert found no record that U-869 received the new orders to Gibraltar. Robert believed U-869 might have continued to New York.
1. John and a friend Barb returned to Washington D.C. to research U-869. John read German radio messages that indicated U-869 went to New York. John excitedly called Richie with the news. The mystery sub was almost certainly U-869.
1. Again, postwar assessors had inaccurately recorded U-869 as “probably sunk” near Gibraltar. In reality, there was no evidence of this.

### Summary
1. This chapter starts in January 1944. It narrates the history of U-869 and its crew. U-869 was built in Deschimag Shipyard in Bremen, Germany.
1. Young German soldiers arrived in Bremen for naval training. Herbert Guschewski was a radioman assigned to U-869. Herbert had served on U-602 before. U-602 went missing on its most recent patrol.
1. After a few weeks of training, the crew met the officers who would command the newly-built U-869. Their commander was Helmuth Neuerburg. Helmuth was a strict man with a strong sense of duty.
1. One night, the crew of U-869 gathered for a pre-departure celebration. Herbert noticed the atmosphere of U-869 was very different from what he experienced with U-602. The mood was much more somber now.
1. Next, the author gives a brief overview of commander Helmuth’s life. Helmuth joined the military when he was 19. While Helmuth had a strong sense of duty, he did not agree with the policies of the Nazi party.
1. Helmuth was married with two children. In 1943, the German military gave him a choice to stay with the naval air force or join the U-boats. Helmuth chose the U-boats and told his brother, “I’m not coming back”.
1. In late January, U-869 departed for the Baltic Sea for more training. The crew got to know each other and their jobs. Herbert Guschewski and Martin Horenburg (another radioman) became quick friends.
1. Next, the author tells us about U-869’s first officer, Siegfried Brandt. Siegfried was 21 and easygoing. He joined the navy in 1941. He had already experienced combat on both a ship and U-boat.
1. Siegfried and his family never agreed with the Nazi party’s principles. The Nazis had threatened to deport Siegried’s family to a concentration camp for refusing to join the Nazi party.
1. For much of 1944, U-869 and its crew underwent testing. The crew passed every test with flying colors. This gave the men confidence. Still, the men knew the odds of coming home were slim.
1. In summer of 1944, commander Helmuth threw a party for the crew. The crew was drunk but kept their composure. The crew thought Helmuth was testing them for any sign of disloyalty.
1. The author tells us about Franz Nedel next. Franz was a torpedoman on U-869. Franz was 19 and engaged to be married. He had a strong loyalty to Hitler and the Nazi party. He was excited to work on a U-boat.
1. Franz’s fiance, Gisela (Gila for short), despised the Nazi party. The Nazis arrested Gila’s father for helping a Jewish family. The Nazis also arrested Franz’s father. Gila wondered how Franz could be so loyal to the Nazis.
1. In summer of 1944, Siegfried took a short leave to visit his family. Afterwards, Siegfried invited his mom and little brother to visit the U-boat. Siegfried’s brother, Hans-Georg, was amazed by the U-boat.
1. In August 1944, U-869 was docked in Poland. The Allies bombed the port. Many men died including a crew member from U-869.
1. In October 1944, a crew member Fritz Dagg stole ham from U-869. To everyone’s surprise, commander Helmuth did not punish Fritz.
1. In fall 1944, the crew spent their last leaves with their families. They had tearful goodbyes with their loved ones. Many men were sure they were on a one-way trip and would never return home.

### Chapter 13 Summary
1. This chapter takes place in the 1990s. By 1993, John and Richie were almost certain that the mystery sub was U-869. Still, they wanted to continue diving to find absolute proof.
1. In 1994, Richie gave up diving for his family. He struggled with this decision, but wanted to put his kids first. Still, Richie thought about the U-boat often. He felt he had a duty to the U-boat crew and their families.
1. At first, John explored the wreck without Richie. He dove the wreck with no plan, and did not recover any identifying artifacts. He became frustrated and decided to focus on other shipwrecks.
1. John spent the next two years making important discoveries about other wrecks. This included the SS Carolina, a passenger ship sunk by a U-boat during World War I.
1. Richie’s ban on diving did not save his marriage. In 1995, he separated from his wife. He gained custody of his children. He started dating a woman named Valentina. Valentina supported Richie’s passion for diving.
1. Meanwhile, John’s marriage deteriorated. John and his wife got a divorce. John was heartbroken so he put all his effort into the U-boat.
1. In 1996, Richie began diving again. John and Richie discussed new places to look for identification on the wreck. They learned that another diver found identification tags in the electric motor room of another U-boat.
1. John and Richie had not explored the electric motor room yet. The room was blocked by an escape trunk. They made plans to use a chain to move the escape trunk out of the way.
1. In 1997, John and Richie went to the wreck. Richie managed to move the escape trunk himself with a crowbar (a dangerous risk). John and Richie had to wait until their second dive to explore due to zero visibility.
1. On the second dive, the divers discovered the electric motor room was blocked by a fuel tank. It was too large to be moved, even by machine.
1. John and Richie returned to the dive boat devastated. On the way home, John devised a dangerous plan for getting past the fuel tank and into the electric motor room.
1. Richie thought John’s plan sounded too dangerous and refused to help. John said he would still implement the plan and needed Richie’s help.
### Chapter 14 Summary
1. This chapter starts in December 1944. It details the last days of U-869’s mission. U-869 traveled from Norway toward the open Atlantic.
1. On December 29, U-869 was instructed to head towards New York. This meant U-869’s original mission was to torpedo enemy ships.
1. For several days, Control tried to radio U-869 for a location update. U-869 did not reply for several days.
1. On January 6, U-869 finally gave Control its location. U-869 was not where Control expected it to be. This indicated Commander Neuerburg took a different route from his orders to avoid the Allies.
1. Meanwhile, the Allies discovered the location of U-869 based on the radio broadcasts. The Americans had orders to destroy U-869.
1. Due to concerns of limited fuel, Control ordered U-869 to Gibraltar. It is thought that U-869 never received these orders.
1. U-869 likely approached the American coast in early February. The author theorizes that Commander Neuerburg spotted an enemy ship and gave orders to fire a torpedo.
1. This chapter is based on the theory that U-869 was destroyed by one of its own torpedoes, also known as a “circle runner”.

#### Chapter 15 Summary 
1. John needed to bypass the huge fuel tank to gain entry into the electric motor room. He made a dangerous plan.
1. First, John planned to wear just one air tank. Then he planned to remove his tank and slip through a small gap to the electric motor room. Richie thought John’s plan was crazy and risky, but agreed to go with.
1. In August 1997, John tested his plan. It went smooth the first time. It did NOT go smooth the second time. John’s video camera did not work and a steel beam fell on him. John managed to free himself from the beam just before running out of air.
1. John returned to the electric motor room with a working camera. He filmed the spare parts boxes he was looking for. He believed he would identify the U-boat on the next trip.
1. On the next trip, John discovered a large pipe laying across the spare parts boxes. The pipe pinned the boxes in place, so he could not retrieve them.
1. John brought a sledgehammer on his next dive. He knocked the pipe and discovered it was an oxygen tube. Even though he knew the oxygen tube might explode, he struck it again. The tube did not explode.
1. John was able to loosen the spare parts boxes from the oxygen tube. John handed the smallest box to Richie. Richie gave the box to another diver to take to the surface.
1. Meanwhile, John noticed he had five minutes of air left in his main tank. He tried to retrieve a second box and realized he was nearly out of air. Then he became tangled in wire on his way out of the room.
1. John freed himself from the wire and launched himself through the opening. By this point, John had run out of air and spit his regulator out. Richie was shocked to see this.
1. With no oxygen, John swam to his extra air tanks 50 feet away. He hooked up an extra tank and began breathing again. John and Richie began their slow rise to the surface.
1. At one of their decompression stops, a diver named Will McBeth delivered some news: the spare parts box had a plate stamped “U-869”.
#### Epilogue Summary
1. How U-869 was sunk would never be known for sure. However, the author argues that U-869 was “almost certainly” sunk by its own torpedo. The author says an acoustically-guided torpedo could turn around and head toward the submarine itself if it missed the initial target.
1. The Harbor Inn (aka Horrible Inn) was turned into an upscale restaurant. Danny Crowell now owns the Seeker and still runs charters. The Seeker rarely returns to U-869.
1. After U-869 was identified, John had little to do with it. He continues diving and experiments with new diving technology. He remains friends with Richie. He is remarried. He quit commercial diving to teach history.
1. Richie continued dating his girlfriend Tina. When Tina was 8 months pregnant with Richie’s child, her ex-boyfriend killed her, then himself. Richie was devastated. He married a woman named Cassie years later.
1. Richie contacted some family members of U-869’s crew. Richie found Martin Horenburg’s daughter. She did not want to speak with Richie, but she gave him photos of Martin. Richie mailed Martin’s knife to her.
1. Richie met a woman named Barbara Bowling, a half-sister of a crewman. Barbara lived in Maryland. Richie took Barbara to the U-869 wreck site. Barbara helped Richie find more family members of the crew.
1. Richie traveled to Germany with Barbara. Richie first met Hans-Georg Brandt, Siegfried Brandt’s younger brother. Hans talked about Siegfried for hours. Richie gave Hans a metal artifact from U-869.
1. Next, Richie spoke with Helmuth Neuerburg’s family. He met Helmuth’s son, Jurgen. Jurgen shared stories and photos of his father. Then Richie spoke to Helmuth’s brother, Friedhelm.
1. Richie met Gisela Engelmann. Gisela was the fiance of Franz Nedel, one of U-869’s torpedoman. Gisela married and had children, but never stopped loving Franz.
1. Finally, Richie met Herbert Guschewski, a radioman on U-869. Days before U-869 left for war, Herbert became sick with pneumonia. The crew of U-869 visited Herbert in the hospital. Herbert remained in the hospital while U-869 departed for war.
1. Herbert told Richie stories about U-869 and the crew. Herbert asked Richie for a memento from U-869. Richie gladly promised to mail Herbert something. Herbert thanked Richie for caring.
