## Dawn
1. I was up before everyone. I was up before the birds and sun.
1. I drank my coffee and ate a piece of toast. I got dressed and put on my green running shoes.
1. I stretched my body and started running down the cool road into the fog.
1. I was all alone. The trees seemed aware of me. This was Oregon. Trees always have your back.
1. I am proud to be from Oregon. It is beautiful, but nothing big ever happened here -- except for the old, old trail.
1. In 1962, I moved back home. I was living with my parents and twin sisters.
1. On paper, I am an adult. I graduated from the University of Oregon. I earned my master's degree in business from Stanford. I also spent a year in the US Army.
1. I was 24, but why did I feel like a kid?
1. I still haven't experienced anything in my life. I haven't smoked a cigarette or tried a drug. This was the '60s, and I was the only person in America who had not rebelled!
1. I wanted something different from life. I wanted to leave a mark on the world.
1. Then it happened. My heart began to pump fast. I had a Crazy Idea. I saw what I wanted my life to be: Play.
1. The secret to happiness is play. I wasn't a pro athlete, but I wanted to feel what athletes feel. I wanted to devote my life to play.
1. I ran faster. I was laughing and drenched in sweat.
1. The world is made up of crazy ideas. The things I love the most - books, sports, democracy, business - started with crazy ideas.
1. Running is crazy. It's hard and painful. People run around a track or down an empty road with no destination. There is no finish line.
1. On the morning of 1962, I told myself: Let everyone else call your idea crazy. Just keep going.
Whatever happens, don't stop.
## 1962
1. When I finally found the courage to tell my father about my Crazy Idea, I made sure he was relaxed. He was watching his favorite show - Red Buttons.
1. I waited for the next commercial. I rehearsed what I was going to say over and over.
1. In one of my final classes in business school, I wrote a paper on how Japanese running shoes might be able to take over the shoe market.
1. I was obsessed with researching everything about starting a shoe company. I gave the presentation to my classmates. They were bored and didn't ask any questions, but my professor gave me an A.
1. I never stopped thinking about that paper. I even thought about bringing the idea to a company in Japan.
1. I wanted to travel and see the world. I wanted to experience other cultures. First, I need my father's approval and his cash.
1. I had some savings, but I still needed $1000 to make this trip happen.
1. I laid it all out to my father. He nodded as he flicked through channels on the TV.
1. I was trying extra hard to convince my father. He was the publisher of the Oregon Journal. The job pays well, but he is not made of money.
1. It was also 1962. Not many people traveled to other countries at that time.
1. As I stopped talking, my father gave me a funny look. He said this trip would be good for me. He agreed to give me the cash.
1. The rest of my family was not very supportive. My grandmother said Japan was a long way from Roseburg, Oregon where we live. Because of the war, many people also had bad feelings about Japan.
1. My sisters didn't care. My mom said nothing as usual, but she seemed proud.
1. I spent weeks preparing for the trip. I decided to invite my college friend Carter. I told him about the 21 cities around the world I wanted to see. He wanted to join.
1. September 7, 1962, Carter and I got into his old Chevy and drove down I-5 all the way to foggy San Francisco. We bought an $80 airplane ticket to Hawaii.
1. When we got to Hawaii, I dove into the ocean and laughed like a crazy person. I told Carter we should stay here.
1. We changed our plan and decided to get jobs selling encyclopedias. Life was sweet.
1. I was not good at selling encyclopedias. I decided to work for a security company instead.
1. The security company was run by one of the most famous businessmen in the 1960s. His name was Bernard Cornfield.
1. I made some sales in my first week. I quickly earned enough money to cover 6 months of rent.
1. Carter and I spent a lot of time at dive bars. We thought about people back home: Why can't they seize the day like us?
1. One night at the bar, I told Carter it was time to get back to The Plan. It was time to leave Hawaii.
1. Carter wanted to stay behind. He had found a beautiful girl. How could I argue?
1. I thought about giving up. A voice inside me told me to keep going.
1. I bought an open plane ticket. On Thanksgiving day 1962, I got on a plane for Japan.
1. I arrived in Tokyo. The cab driver dropped me off at the hostel I was staying in. It was very run down.
1. Luckily my father had friends in Tokyo. I went to see them. They fed me and told me of a better hotel to stay in.
1. I told them about my Crazy Idea. They advised me to talk to two men who worked for a magazine called The Importer.
1. I went off to see the city. I spent time in temples, shrines, and gardens. I read about the religions Buddhism and Shinto.
1. Zen says: There is no future. There is no past. There is only now.
1. I decided to take a break from Zen and go to the opposite – the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It was crazy. Hundreds of men screaming and pulling their hair out.
1. The next morning, I went for a run to the fish market. More craziness. This time with fish flying everywhere.
1. That night, I took a bus up to the Hakone Mountains. I decided I would come back to climb it when I had something to celebrate.
1. I went back to Tokyo and met up with the two men at The Importer. I told them I wanted to go to a shoe factory in Kobe. They said I needed to learn a few things about doing business with the Japanese.
1. Negotiations in Japan are difficult. Sometimes it is hard to get a yes or no.
1. I went to Kobe the next morning. I was so excited, I showed up at the wrong place.
1. I was greeted by 4 men. They showed me around the huge factory. When we passed through the accounting department, everyone got up and bowed. I never know when to bow back.
1. I was given a place of honor at the table. I could not remember my speech.
1. I began to talk. I thought about the Blue Ribbons I'd won in track. I told them I was with the Blue Ribbon shoe company.
1. I explained I wanted to sell Tiger Shoes in American stores. It would be very profitable.
1. The men began to speak to each other excitedly. Then they got up and left. Does this mean rejection? Do I leave now?
1. They came back and showed me shoe designs they hope to sell in America. They wanted to enter America's shoe market for a long time. They wanted to send me shoe samples to start selling.
1. We bowed to each other. We shook hands. At that moment, the war had not happened. We were brothers.
1. Back in my hotel I thought about going home, but I was still curious about the world.
1. I went to Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Bangcock. I ate foods I will never see again. In front of a Buddha statue, I asked myself: Why am I here? What is my purpose?
1. I went to Vietnam. I flew to Kathmandu and climbed the Himalayas.
1. I went to Kenya, Egypt, and Jerusalem. I headed to Kenya and watched giant ostriches run next to buses.
1. I went to Istanbul, Greece, and Rome. I was out by dawn every morning to beat the crowds.
1. My time was running out. I wanted to go home. I quickly heeded to Paris and then to Munich and Berlin.
1. At last, I flew to London. On my last night, I thought about my favorite part of the trip. It was definitely Greece.
1. Before my flight, I meditated and thought about the moment I stood in front of the Acropolis in Greece. The temple of Athena Nike was next to me. "Nike" means victory.
1. A famous statue shows the Athena Nike leaning down to adjust her shoe.
1. I came home on my 25th birthday. My mother cried. I looked at my Blue Ribbons and thought about the day the Japanese business men asked for my company name.
1. When my Dad came home, he wanted to hear every detail. I needed to know one thing first: Did the sample shoes come in?
## 1963
1. My father invited the neighbors over to see a slideshow of my trip. I stood in front of the projector and spoke. All I could think of was the pyramids, the Temple of Nike, and my shoes.
1. It was 4 months since meeting with the executives at Onitsuka. My shoes have still not arrived. I wrote them a letter.
1. The executives replied quickly and said it will be a few more days. My father did not think the shoes were coming.
1. My hair and beard had grown long. I could tell my mother and sisters did not like it, so I shaved it. Afterward I told myself, "It's official, you're back."
1. It felt there was something about me that would never return.
1. I needed money. My father told me to go talk to his friend Don Frisbee, CEO of Pacific Power and Light. I had an internship with Mr. Frisbee before.
1. I told Mr. Frisbee about some of my ideas for jobs. He told me to become a Certified Public Accountant. I still needed 9 more hours of classes to qualify for the exam. I enrolled at Portland State.
1. After completing my classes, I joined a small accounting firm. It was a lot of work! During the busy season we worked 12 hour days, 6 days a week.
1. When President Kennedy was killed on November 1st, I asked for the day off to mourn. My boss said no.
1. I was earning $500 a month. I bought a green Plymouth Valiant.
1. Each day during lunch I would walk to the local travel agency and look at the posters in the window. I asked myself "Are the best moments of my life behind me? Was my trip around the world...my peak?"
## 1964
1. The shoes from Japan arrived. I gave 2 pairs to my old track coach, Bill Bowerman.
1. I loved and feared Bowerman the same way I felt about my father. Oddly, they were both named Bill.
1. On January 25, 1964, I met with Bowerman. He wanted a dozen pairs of Tiger shoes for his team and to become my business partner.
1. Next, I met with Bowerman's lawyer, named Jaqua. Jaqua said "50-50 is not so hot for the Coach." They did not want to be in charge. They asked to split the deal 51-49. I trusted him.
1. I wrote Onitsuka and asked to be the distributor of Tiger Shoes in the western United States. I asked them to send 300 pairs of Tigers. I had to ask my dad for more money. He thought I was wasting my time.
1. Both of my parents grew up in poverty. My parents were opposites. When their opposite personalities caused problems, my dad drank, and my mother turned to stone.
1. When my father accused me of "jackassing around," my mother asked to buy a pair of shoes. My father decided to loan me the money.
1. In April, a letter came from Mr. Miyazaki saying I could be the distributor for Onitsuka in the West.
1. I quit my accounting job and sold shoes out of the trunk of my Valiant. I couldn't write orders fast enough.
1. People would write to me to buy shoes. Without trying, my mail-order business was born. Sometimes, people would show up at my parents' house.
1. In July 1964, I sold out my first shipment. I wrote to Tiger and ordered 900 more pairs of shoes. The cost was $3,000. My father told me the Bank of Dad is now closed.
1. I went to Los Angeles to try to sell more shoes. I attended a track meet and ran into an old running friend, Jeff Johnson. On weekends he sold Adidas. I told him to work for me instead. He was getting married soon and said no.
1. I was as happy as ever. Then, I got a letter from a high school wrestling coach, Mr. Hanhasset. He looked just like the Marlboro Man.
1. In the letter, Mr Hanhasset said he just came back from Japan, and the executives at Onitsuka, appointed him their exclusive American distributor. He ordered me to stop.
1. I thought about giving up on my dream of selling shoes. I couldn't. I flew back to Japan and met with Onitsuka. My parents supported me.
1. I spent the flight reading How to Do Business with the Japanese. I couldn't let my emotions get in the way.
1. When I got to Japan, I called Onitsuka and left a message, "I'm here, and I request a meeting." Mr. Onitsuka decided I could sell track shoes in the 13 western states. The Marlboro Man could sell his wrestling shoes nationwide. He could only sell track shoes on the East Coast.
1. I ran and skipped back to my hotel. Life felt beautiful again!
1. Next, I climbed Mount Fuji. As I passed people, I learned what gear I needed. I could do some things at the stations going up the mountain. I bought a jacket from a man coming down the mountain.
1. I passed station 3 several times and became worried about the Japanese count differently.
1. I stopped at station 7 for ramen and a beer. I talked to two people while I ate. The woman's name was Sarah and she was from Maryland.
1. I walked down the mountain with Sarah and the man. Sarah asked me where I was staying and then said she was coming with me.
1. We spent 2 days together at the inn. We did not have plans to see each other again. Sarah was a free spirit. She did like to make plans.
1. Before I boarded my plane, I stopped at the American Express office. I knew Sarah would have to stop there. I left her a note: "You've got to fly over Portland to get to the East Coast...why not stop for a visit?"
1. My first night home I told my family about Sarah and that I saved my company.
1. Weeks later, I came home from running errands and Sarah was in my living room. She called from the airport and my sister picked her up.
1. We went on a walk. I asked her where she was staying. "Silly boy," she said. This was the second time she'd invited herself into my space.
1. For 2 weeks she lived in my parents' guestroom, just like one of the family. She had the kind of self-confidence you run across once or twice in a lifetime.
1. I wrote to Sarah every other day after she left. She always wrote back right away and expressed her undying love.
1. She returned to Portland for Christmas. She told me her parents forbade her to come. They didn't approve of me.Sarah's brother snuck her out of the house that morning.
1. When I was working during the day, Sarah hung out with my mother. At night, we went downtown for dinner and drinks. On the weekend we skied Mount Hood.
1. When Sarah went home, we wrote letters. Slowly there was a slight cooling in her letters.
1. I called Sarah to find out. She said she'd given it a lot of thought and we weren't right for each other. Before I could say anything, she hung up the phone.
1. I wrote to Sarah and begged her to reconsider. She wrote back right away. No sale.
1. When a new shipment arrived from Onitsuka, I could hardly bring myself to care. I didn't tell my family, but they knew. No one asked for details, except my sister, Jeanne.
1. Jeanne snuck into my desk and read all of my letters. She told me, "You're better off without her".
1. Not knowing what to say, I asked Jeanne if she'd like to do some part-time work for Blue Ribbon. "Since you're so interested in mail, maybe you'd enjoy doing some secretarial work. Dollar and a half an hour?" She laughed.
1. My sister became the first-ever employee of Blue Ribbon.
## 1965
1. I got a letter from Jeff Johnson. He really liked the Tiger shoes. He needed extra money, so I offered him a salesman job.
1. Johnson wrote to me a lot. I began to wonder if I made a mistake hiring him.
1. I was too tired to write him back. I asked Jeanne to deal with him instead.
1. Johnson sold a lot of shoes. I was surprised. He ended up quitting his job to focus on shoe sales.
1. In 1965, running was not a sport. Running for exercise was not as common as it is now. Runners would get laughed at.
1. Johnson begged me again and again to hire him as a full-time employee. I finally agreed.
1. My banker was upset with me. He told me my company was growing too fast and would fail.
1. I needed to grow so Onitsuka thought I was the best. My banker still told me to slow down.
1. Wallace is the boss of my banker. He is the Vice President at First National Bank. Wallace did not believe in me.
1. The shoes were always coming in late. I complained to Onitsuka, but it didn't help.
1. I decided to get a real job in case my company failed. I became an accountant.
1. I used my paychecks to support Blue Ribbon. I learned more about how to run a company successfully. Equity was important.
1. The best accountant I met was Hayes. He could use numbers to tell the future. He also drank, ate, and talked a lot.
1. Many nights, I would join Hayes for drinks. I would wake up in the morning feeling sick.
1. I was still serving in the military. On Tuesday, we were stationed next to the warehouse where I picked up the first shipment of shoes.
1. In the Army Reserves, we talked about military strategy. They told us war in Vietnam was coming. We might as well say goodbye to our family.
1. I told Hayes about my shoe company. He said this economy was not the best for starting a business.
1. Bowerman started making changes to the shoes. He made them fit Americans better.
1. Bowman fixed the sole and the arch support. He kept sending shoe changes to Onitsuka.
1. Bowerman gave the new shoes to all his runners to try at track meets. He kept experimenting with the design.
1. I don't know how Bowerman fits everything into one day. He's also writing a book about jogging. He said: everyone's an athlete.
## 1966
1. My contract with Onitsuka was about to end. I checked the mail every day. All I got were letters from Johnson.
1. Johnson always pointed out that I had not responded to his other letters. I look back now and wonder if I was myself or I was imitating Bowerman, or my father, or both. Was I adopting their man-of-few-words demeanor?
1. Johnson collected customer feedback and brought it to me. One man complained that the Tigers would not hold up as he ran the Boston Marathon. Johnson hired a cobbler to graft rubber soles from a pair of shower shoes into a pair of Tiger flats. The customer reached his personal best in the race.
1. Blue Ribbon was supposed to be limited to the 13 western states, but Johnson had customers in 37 states. Marlboro Man wasn't doing anything with his territory, so it seemed harmless. I didn't tell Johnson my concern.
1. Then, Johnson wrote me two letters I couldn't ignore. The first was that he and his wife were getting divorced. Days later, the second letter said he had been in a car crash. He fell asleep on the way to a road race. His collarbone, foot, and skull were shattered.
1. In follow-up letters, he told me he could still meet all of his obligations. Johnson added that because he was now facing alimony, child support, and untold medical bills.
1. Johnson asked about the long-term plan for Blue Ribbon. I told him that Blue Ribbon will likely become a sporting goods company and  probably have offices on the West Coast and, one day, maybe in Japan.
1. I told Johnson that if he could sell 3,250 pairs of Tigers by the end of June 1966, I would let him open a store. I didn't think he could do it. He proved me wrong.
1. Before Labor Day, he'd leased a small space in Santa Monica, CA, and opened our first-ever store. Johnson turned the store into a beautiful space for runners to hang out.
1. Johnson told me a coach was talking about getting Tigers from a new source. Johnson did a good job selling Tigers. Now, Marlboro Man was going to swoop in? I got on the next plane to Los Angeles.
1. I made it to Johnson's apartment. His apartment looked like your standard Divorced Guy Pad. It was filled with shoes.
1. Johnson also had a 75-gallon saltwater fish tank. He had many exotic creatures, including seahorses, opal-eye perch, and a baby octopus named Stretch.
1. He took out a crab to feed the octopus. I watched the octopus inject the crab with poison. Johnson smiled like a proud dad. It was a morbid puppet show. Nature is brutal. I wondered if it would also be the story of Blue Ribbon and the Marlboro Man.
1. We spent the evening talking about Marlboro Man. Johnson told me I had to go to Japan to stop him, but I didn't have the money.
1. I returned to Oregon. That afternoon, I went to the office to see the office manager Price Waterhouse. I told him I needed two weeks off immediately.
1. My boss at Price Waterhouse looked up from his papers. At first, I thought he was going to fire me. Then I realized that he thought I got someone pregnant. I let him think what he wanted. I just wanted the time off.
1. I put the airfare on my credit card. I told the executives at Onitsuka I was coming and wanted a meeting. They told me to come. Morimoto was either fired or dead. I would be meeting with the new export manager, Kitami.
1. I realized I was an important client for Onitsuka. Location was everything. I was selling shoes in America.
1. I told Kitami and the other executives about how successful Blue Ribbon has been. We had $40,000 in sales in 1966 and planned to have $84,000 in 1976.
1. At first, the executives and Kitami's faces looked grim. They wanted someone bigger and who had offices on the East Coast. I told him, "Blue Ribbon does have offices on the East Coast." This made them reconsider. Kitami would call the following day.
1. The next morning, I got a call to return to Onitsuka. Kitami awarded me exclusive rights to distribute Tigers in the United States. He gave me a 3-year contract.
1. I signed the papers and ordered 5,000 more shoes. These would cost 20,000. I didn't have the money. I also didn't have an office on the East Coast.
1. I looked out the window on my flight back and thought about Mount Fuji. I wondered how Sarah would feel about me now after my lie. I wondered how the Marlboro Man would feel when he got word from Onitsuka that he was toast.
1. I imagined the look on Wallace's face at the bank when I asked him for another loan. If he said no, when he said no, what then? If he said yes, I still did not have an office on the East Coast.
1. There was only one person on the planet who was spontaneous and energetic enough to pick up and move to the East Coast. I wondered how Johnson was going to like the Atlantic Ocean.
## 1967
1. I did not want to tell Johnson the whole story about the meeting in Japan. I was afraid of his reaction.
1. I told him we got the rights to sell our shoes in the entire United States. I did not tell him we needed to hire someone to work on the East Coast.
1. I hired an old track coach in Los Angeles to take Johnson's spot without telling Johnson.
1. I finally told Johnson he needed to move to the East Coast and sell the shoes. The fate of the company rested in his hands.
1. Johnson did not want to move to the East Coast because he loved California.
1. When he realized no one else could get the job done, he convinced himself to go.
1. We decided Boston would be a great place to start a new store since a lot of orders came from there.
1. I was grateful for Johnson, and felt bad about never answering his letters.
1. Then, Johnson said he would quit if I didn't make him a partner for Blue Ribbon or give him a raise. I had to make a choice.
1. I called Bowerman about the deal, but he did not want to give up any part of the company. Neither could I.
1. I met with Johnson and his father. His father gave a big speech about how much Johnson had done for Blue Ribbon.
1. I agreed with him, but I could not make him a partner. We were broke. Instead, I offered him a $50 raise.
1. Johnson accepted the offer because of his love for Blue Ribbon.
1. I got a call from Bowerman about hiring one of his former track players: Geoff Hollister. We got along fine, so I offered him a job.
1. Bowerman called again. This time, he asked for a fourth employee. His name was Woodell.
1. Woodell was an Oregon track star. Now he was paralyzed, and Bowerman wanted to keep him busy.
1. I went out to lunch with Woodell. We had a great time, and I offered him the job. We Oregon men take care of each other.
1. Bowerman also sent me the results of his new shoe modifications. He created a new shoe for long distance running. It was amazing.
1. We wanted to call the new shoe the Aztec, but Adidas threatened to sue us. They had a shoe coming out with the same name.
1. Instead, we called it the Cortez. 
1. Bowerman was inspiring many people with his jogging book. He sold a million copies. The book made running seem cool.
1. I was happy for him. I was also happy that the book could help our shoe sales.
1. When I read the book, I was confused. Bowerman said brands were not important. Why did he join Blue Ribbon if he thought this?
1. The Cortez shoes ended up being easy to sell. We met our money goal that year.
1. I decided my apartment was getting too small for our business. I rented an office.
1. Woodell and I fixed up the office and bought some desks. Business was very slow. How are we going to build this shoe company?
1. I thought about moving into the office and getting rid of my apartment. I thought it was crazy.
1. Then, Johnson sent a letter saying he had moved into his office.
1. Johnson rented an office in Wellesley. This was a small town that people would run through during the Boston Marathon.
1. Johnson wrote a letter to me asking for money and furniture for the office. I didn't answer.
## 1968
1. I was working 6 days a week at Price Waterhouse. I was spending all my other time at Blue Ribbon. My life was out of balance, but I didn't care.
1. I wanted to spend all my time at Blue Ribbon, but we weren't selling enough shoes to give me a salary. I needed money.
1. I decided to quit Price Waterhouse. I got a job as an assistant professor teaching accounting at Portland State. The job paid $700 a month.
1. My father told me teaching is not a respectable job, especially at Portland State. "What am I going to tell my friends?" he asked.
1. Many of the students seemed bored and not interested in being in class. There was one student in the front row that I couldn't take my eyes off of. Her name was Miss Parks. Penelope Parks.
1. After a few weeks, Miss Parks came to my office and asked me to be her advisor. I asked her if she wanted to work for Blue Ribbon as a bookkeeper. I offered her $2 an hour. It was a deal!
1. Miss Parks was dedicated to Blue Ribbon. She had a remarkable way with people. Everyone loved Miss Parks, too.
1. The impact of Miss Parks was most apparent in Woodell. He was going through a rough time. He was often sick for weeks. Miss Parks brought back the color in his cheeks. She had a healing effect on him, and seeing this had an effect on me too.
1. There were several long looks between Miss Parks and me. There were many awkward pauses too. One night, I saw her desk drawer open. Inside, I saw her uncashed paychecks. One day, I asked her to dinner.
1. We went on two dates - to the Oregon Zoo, and a Chinese restaurant for dinner. At dinner, Miss Parks told me to call her Penny. After dinner, I drove her home and met her parents.
1. I brought Penny home to meet my family. Penny later told me my house was the opposite of her house. Her house was noisy and full of animals.
1. Next, she brought me home, and I saw everything she told me. The carpets were stained from the animals - a German shepherd, a monkey, a cat, white rats, and an ill-tempered goose. Chaos was the rule. After dinner, we invited Penny's mother, Dot, to get a drink with us.
1. After two hours, Penny switched to water, but not Dot. Dot kept on going and going, and soon she was dancing with all sorts of strange men.
1. I had to ask Dot for permission to take Penny on a weekend trip to Sacramento. Penny still lived in their house and needed to obey their rules. Dot said no. I came back the next day and convinced her to allow the trip.
1. We flew to Sacramento. Penny was always in a good mood. She never complained. Even in the 100 degree weather. At some point, I brought up our future. I told her I wanted to continue to date, but Portland State frowned on teacher-student relationships. We'd have to get married.
1. I needed to leave for Japan the next day. I asked Penny to organize the wedding while I was gone. She said yes.
1. We told our friends and family about the news. At first, Penny's mom did not take it well, but came around to the idea.
1. It took a while to sink in that I was getting married. Not until I left for Japan and kissed Penny good-bye did reality hit me. I had more than a fiancée, a lover, a friend. I had a partner. And it was different from Bowerman and Johnson. This alliance was life-altering.
1. I arrived in Japan. Kitami was still at Onistsuka. I brought new shoe designs that Bowerman and Johnson designed. Kitami liked them. One afternoon he invited me to a picnic as an honorary member of the Export Department.
1. Toward the end of the picnic I sat on the beach and looked out across the Pacific Ocean. I grew to love Japan. I connected with the shyness of the Japanese people, with the simplicity of their culture and products and art. I liked that the radio announced which trees, on which corners, were blossoming, and how much.
1. A man named Fujimoto sat beside me on the beach. I could see he was trying to be social with me. He told me he lost his home months ago in a Typhoon. The one thing he hasn't been able to replace was his bike. They were very expensive in Japan. I told him about Penny and our wedding in September. Fujimoto told me that he may be in Los Angeles one month later and invited me to meet him. When I returned home, I mailed Fujimoto money for a bike.
1. On September 13, 1968, Penny and I got married at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Portland. It was one year, nearly to the day, after Miss Parks first walked into my classroom. She was again in the front row, only this time I was standing beside her. And she was now Mrs. Knight.
1. After the wedding, we drove to the coast, two hours away, where we planned to spend the weekend at her parent's beach house. Penny's mom called every half hour.
## 1969
1. Suddenly, we had many new employees. We were making about $300,000 in sales.
1. I decided to quit teaching. I worked full-time for Blue Ribbon and gave myself a salary of $18,000 a year.
1. I hired an artist from campus to help advertise for the company. People were telling me advertising was going to be important.
1. The Olympics was in Mexico City in 1969. Bowerman reported many athletes were wearing Tigers for training, not competing. We had no money to pay athletes to wear our shoes.
1. Kitami and Mr. Onitsuka were also in Mexico City. After the Olympics, they flew to the United States. They visited Blue Ribbon. They looked surprised to see the small office. I apologized and thought: it's all over.
1. I was nervous about Kitami and Onitsuka. I sent out a message to the whole company. I explained that I hired a spy who works at the factory in Japan. I knew it was a mistake to send that email, but I did it anyway.
1. Penny and I were learning to live together. She learned I could not cook or clean and I was not organized.
1. We were living on a tight budget. Penny still managed to make it work.
1. In the Spring, Penny found out she was pregnant. We were happy but not feeling prepared. I told myself: Life is growth. You grow, or you die.
1. We bought a house in Beaverton. If the company failed, we would also lose the house. Penny continued to work during her pregnancy.
1. Woodell and I started looking around for bigger offices each night. We became closer. Even with his injury, he found a way to be happy.
1. Woodell was like family. Penny always made us a good meal when he came for dinner.
1. We finally found a new office space in Tigard. I offered Woodell a promotion to Operations Manager. He accepted the deal.
1. Penny went into labor. I waited in "The Bullpen," a waiting room where expectant fathers sat while their wives gave birth. I sat in a hard plastic chair until our boy was born. We named him Matthew.
1. Something made me want to talk with my father. I bought cigars on the way.
1. Everyone seemed to be content. Then, a letter came from Bork. He was unhappy with how I managed the company and wanted a raise. I told him he could quit if he wanted.
1. I regretted my letter back to Bork. I had Woodell go see him and repair the damage. He came back to tell me that we needed to move the warehouse to Oregon, and his mom would run it.
## 1970
1. Two weeks before Christmas, I had to go to Japan again. Mr. Onitsuka opened the meeting by saying he wanted to renew Blue Ribbon for another 3 years. I asked for 5 years. He said no.
1. Mr. Onitsuka said that sales for the next year were expected to be $22 million. A lot of these sales would come from the United States. I knew that I had something to do with that. That's why I wanted a longer contract.
1. Mr. Onitsuka congratulated Kitami for the sales. Kimati was being promoted. I congratulated Kitami, but he gave me a cold look when I made eye contact with him. It stayed with me for days.
1. I returned home anxious. I wondered why they wouldn't extend my contract longer than 3 years.
1. Woodell eventually figured out that Onitsuka was filling local orders in Japan first, then worrying about foreign orders. I couldn't do anything about it.
1. If Onitsuka could fill all the correct orders, I'd still have problems with Wallace at the bank. Bigger orders require bigger loans. Bigger loans are harder to pay off.
1. Woodell showed me a telex from Onitsuka. The big spring shipment was ready, and they wanted $20,000. We didn't have the money. I asked them to hold the shoes.
1. We tried to sell shares of Blue Ribbon. It wasn't working. We only sold 300 shares to Woodell and his mom. Over the next month, I pulled together $20,000.
1. Now I needed cash. I did what I vowed never to do. I reached out to some friends, family and casual acquaintances. I pitched to my former track rival, Grelle. He was not interested. I had nowhere else to turn.
1. One day, Woodwell came into my office and told me his family wanted to loan me $5,000. He said they wouldn't take no for an answer.
1. Woodell went to see Bork in Los Angeles but told me to go pick up the check from his family. I knew that $5,000 was their life's savings. Their son had medical bills, too.
1. I drove to the Woodell family's house. They told me they had a little more money left and asked if I needed it. They gave me their last $3,000, draining their savings down to $0.
1. On my way out the door, I asked them, "Why are you doing this?" "Because," Woodell's mother said, "if you can't trust the company your son is working for, then who can you trust?"
1. One morning, getting dressed for work, I put on one of my baggier suits, and it wasn't baggy. Standing in front of the mirror, I said to my reflection: "Uh-oh."
1. I didn't want to be the fat and lazy head of a running shoe company. Grelle and I started running together. I also started running six miles every night after work.
1. I was flipping through a Fortune magazine. I saw a story about my previous boss in Hawaii. Another article said that 25 years after Hiroshima, Japan was reborn - being third in the world's economy. They were outthinking and outworking other countries. Japan had ruthless trade policies.
1. One day, I walked out of the First National Bank and saw a sign for the Bank of Tokyo. I decided to walk over. I told the Bank of Tokyo about my shoe company. I told them about the article I read and asked if they knew of any trading companies.
1. He told me that Japan's 6th largest trading company had an office on the top floor of the same building, Nissho Iwai. Minutes later, he returned with an executive from Nissho Iwai. We discussed the possibility of Nissho financing my future imports. Nissho offered me a deal, but I had to check with Onitsuka first. Weeks passed without hearing from Onitsuka.
1. While waiting to hear back, I got a call from a shoe distributor on the East Coast. Onitsuka asked them about becoming its new U.S. distributor. He wanted to know about the status of my deal. I began to shake.
1. I wondered, was Onitsuka planning to break the contract? Were they concerned about my finances?
1. I wrote to Fujimoto. He wrote back telling me that the distributor was telling the truth. Onitsuka was considering a clean break with Blue Ribbon. Kimati was in touch with several distributors in the United States. Fujimoto said there was no firm plan. There was still hope.
1. I needed to remind Kitami what Blue Ribbon was and who I was. I needed to invite Kitami to the United States for a friendly visit.

## 1971
1. Kitami was coming to Portland for a visit. Woodell and I agreed that we needed Kitami to have a great time. We would end his visit with dinner at Bowerman's house.
1. Penny and I took Kitami and his assistant, Hiraku Iwano, to her parents' beach house on the Oregon Coast. We tried to charm them in any way possible.
1. Then, I took Kitami to First National Bank. Kitami demanded to know why they would not give Blue Ribbon more money. The banker angrily walked out after the conversation.
1. I took Kitami to our new offices. He sat down and scolded me: Blue Ribbon should be doing much better.
1. He got up to use the restroom. I snuck into his briefcase and stole one of his folders. It was a list of other United States shoe distributors.
1. I was disappointed. Kitami was meeting with our competition even after all Blue Ribbon had done for them.
1. The next day, I snuck the list back in Kitami's briefcase when he visited the office.
1. On Kitami's last day we went over to Bowerman's house for dinner. Kitami and I had one thing in common: Mai Tais. It reminded us of Hawaii.
1. Bowerman never drank. He became a new person after two drinks. He was slurring his words and spilling things. I was concerned.
1. Kitami seemed to be having a good time at the dinner. Then, he grabbed a guitar and sang many verses of "O Sole Mio"
1. I realized this trip was not about the company. This trip was about Kitami.
1. I tried to keep the peace one more time. I invited Kitami back to the office.
1. Then, he asked me if I would sell Blue Ribbon. He said it was the best option. I was angry. I told him I would need to talk to Bowerman first.
1. I went to the bank the next day. Wallace told me that First National would no longer do business with Blue Ribbon.
1. I asked for advice from everyone I could. I ended up taking out a small loan from the Bank of California.
1. I went back to the Japanese trading company, Nissho. I met with Tom Sumeragi. Sumeragi wanted me to start using a different Japanese shoe company. 
1. I was very tired when I got home every night. I still tried to find time to read Matthew a bedtime story.
1. I came up with a plan. First, I need to send letters to scare away my competitors. Second, I need to replace Onitsuka.
1. I decided to set up a meeting with a company in Mexico. Its name was Canada. I signed a contract for football shoes since my contract with Onitsuka was for track and field shoes.
1. Now I needed a new logo. I met with Carolyn Davidson, the artist, again. I asked her to create something that made customers think: motion.
1. After many attempts, Carolyn finally created one we all liked. It looked like a wing or whoosh of air.
1. Next we needed a name. Falcon? Condor? Dimension Six? I was running out of patience. We were running out of time.
1. A name came to Johnson in a dream: Nike. Nike was the goddess of victory. I was not sure about the name or the logo, but I sent them to Canada before the deadline.
1. I was nervous about my new relationship with Nissho.
1. Canada's shoes fell apart in the cold weather. We needed a new factory.
1. Sumeragi helped by introducing me to Sole. He was a Shoe Dog. This meant he was obsessed with shoes.
1. Sole told us about 5 good shoe factories in Japan. Sumeragi and I went to visit them with Sole's son because Solen recently had a heart attack.
1. The first factory we visited was near Hiroshima. I was sad to see everything that had been burned from the war.
1. Sole Jr. was very rude to the factory men. We did not say anything to him because we needed his father's help.
1. Another factory quickly shipped us samples. They were almost perfect. I made names for the shoes and ordered more.
1. I decided to visit Onitsuka before I left. I asked Penny if she would join me.
1. Then, Penny had a panic attack in the hotel bathroom. This was too much for her.
1. Penny and I went to Onitsuka the next day. Everyone was delighted to see us. Fujimoto stayed at our hotel that night. He told us that Onitsuka still planned to end business with Blue Ribbon.
1. When I got back to Portland, I met with Bowerman and Woodell. Bowerman was talking about the new polyurethane track at the University of Oregon. Woodell and I talked about creating new outer sole designs.
1. Bowerman was inspired by our meeting. He started experimenting with materials in his garage. He used a waffle maker to create a new sole made of rubber.
1. It took Bowerman a couple tries, but it worked! I shipped the new waffle shoe design over to our new factory.
1. I wonder if Bowerman knows how much his shoes are changing the world.
## 1972
1. We decided to introduce the world to Nike at the 1972 National Sporting Goods Association Show in Chicago. Sales reps from around the world would be here.
1. We were not prepared. The new "Nikes" didn't have the same quality of Tigers. The "swoosh" logo on the side was crooked. This was not the time to introduce flawed shoes.
1. A mob of salesmen came over. They picked up the Nikes and held them to the light. They touched the shoosh. They asked what it meant. I said, "It's the sound of someone going past you." They liked that. By the end of the day we were one of the smash hits of the show.
1. Good news travels fast, but bad news travels faster. Two weeks later, Kitami walked into my office demanding to know about Nike and who made the new shoes. I told him they were made by different factories in Japan.
1. Kitami said Blue Ribbon breached its contract by making Nike shoes. Our contract with Onitsuka was over, effective immediately.
1. The next day, everyone gathered at the office. I felt weirdly at peace. I told the team about the situation. I watched everyone's jaw drop. It seemed like the end times.
1. I cleared my throat. "This is—the moment we've been waiting for. Our moment. No more selling someone else's brand. No more working for someone else." Everyone around the table lifted their eyes. They sat up straighter.
1. I told the team, "We made 2 million in sales last year. This is not a crisis. This is our Independence Day. We are still alive." I could tell this brought everyone relief.
1. Next, we turned our attention to the Olympic track and field trials. They were held in our backyard: Eugene. The main event of the trials between Prefontaine and the great Olympian George Young. Prefontaine was universally known as "Pre." He was a superstar.
1. Pre was always putting on a show. He was conscious of the spotlight. He didn't care if he died crossing the finish line, so long as he crossed first.
1. All Oregonians loved Pre because he was "ours." Every Oregonian felt emotionally invested in his career. Blue Ribbon was preparing to put our money where our emotions were. In time, we were certain he would be a Nike athlete.
1. For eleven laps, Pre and Young were neck and neck. The crowd was roaring when they entered the final lap. Pre reached down and found another level of energy—we saw him do it. He got in the lead by one yard, then two, then five.
1. Both men broke the American record. We cheered so loud.
1. I never witnessed anything like that race. I felt like I took part in it. I decided that this is what sports are and what they can do. Sports give people a sense of living other lives, by taking part in other people's victories and defeats.
1. That race was part of me and would forever be part of me. I vowed it would also be part of Blue Ribbon. In our coming battles, we would be like Pre. We would compete as if our lives depended on it.
1. We looked forward to the Olympics in Munich. Not only was our Bowerman going to be the head coach of the track team, but Pre was going to be the star.
1. Right before Pre and Bowerman left for Germany, I filed for a patent on Bowerman's waffle shoe. It was a golden moment of my life.
1. In the second week of the Munich Olympic Games, eight masked men climbed a back wall of the Olympic village and kidnapped and killed eleven Israeli athletes. We all grieved. It was a grim time.
1. I went to see Bowerman when he got back from Germany. Bowerman and Pre were close to the attack. He said it was the lowest point in his life. The day after our talk, Bowerman announced he was retiring from coaching.
1. Finally, we had some good news. We heard that a fiery Romanian tennis player named Ilie Nastase was destroying every opponent while wearing Nike Match Points.
1. If we were going to compete with Adidas and all the other brands popping up, we needed top athletes wearing our brand. Now here was a top athlete already wearing Nike, and winning in it. How hard could it be to sign him?
1. I called and offered Nastase a deal. We settled on $10,000. I felt that I was being robbed. But now Nike had a celebrity athlete endorser.
1. Back then, the University of Oregon Ducks and the dreaded Oregon State Beavers were big rivals.
1. My Ducks usually lost by a lot. In 1972, my Ducks lost to the Beavers eight times. But now my Ducks were going to wear Nikes.
1. Penny and I watched a game standing in the rain. The Ducks won 30-3. And they were wearing my shoes!
1. This is how 1972 needed to end -- with a victory.
## 1973
1. Pre wasn't himself after the 1972 Olympics. He was enraged by the terrorist attacks and felt like he let everyone down by his performance.
1. We tried to cheer him up and told him Oregon still loved him. After six months the fire in Pre's belly returned.
1. Pre was setting records, and doing it in Nikes.
1. He began talking about redeeming himself at the 1976 Olympics, but his draft lottery for going to fight in Vietnam was bad. There was little doubt he would be drafted after he graduated.
1. Above all else at that time, Pre was broke. Olympic athletes were not allowed to collect endorsement or government money. The business was worried about Pre, so we hired him.
1. His job title was National Director of Public Affairs, I told people it meant he could run fast. It also meant he was our second celebrity athlete endorser.
1. Everyone was starstruck by Pre, except Hollister, they acted more like brothers. We changed Hollisters role to be Pre's full time liaison, to expose Pre to everywhere and nowhere.
1. Pre preached Nike like gospel, and told everyone he knew to give this new groovy shoe brand a try.
1. Johnson was inspired by Pre, and designed a shoe with him in mind for the 1976 Olympics. It would be our jazziest shoe yet, with the best spike quality thus far.
1. I decided Johnson would complete the shoe in Oregon, not Boston. He was becoming a fine designer and we needed him here.
1. At a business meeting in Japan I told Johnson and Woodell they would be switching locations. They both complained, but came around. I was deeply grateful.
1. In the spring of 1973 I met with the recent investors, I had to tell for the first time in Blue Ribbon history we'd lost money.
1. I told them that even though we had $3.2 million in sales, we still showed a net loss of $57,000. I had 30 disappointed faces looking at me.
1. I left thinking I would never, ever take this company public. 1. Onitsuka filed a lawsuit against us in Japan, we filed one back in the United States. I hired my Cousin Houser as our lawyer, I trusted him and he was all I could afford.
1. I spent much of the year reviewing documents and things I had said and done wrong. I thought about hiding them from the judge, but thought it was best to play it straight.
1. It was a hard time. Running and spending time with Penny and Matthew are what saved my life.
1. I was worried. Matthew was becoming rebellious and Penny was pregnant again. I didn't know how he would handle a sibling and it was possible I would not have a job by the end of the year.
1. In the evening Penny and I would discuss the looming trial. Then have my nightly call with my father to go over things he'd read in the law books. Our chats always made me feel better.
1. My Cousin Houser brought in a new young lawyer from UC Berkeley named Rob Strasser. Everything about him was different from me, yet I felt an instant kinship.
1. Strasser and I bonded in many ways. I asked what he thought our chances of winning were, and he said without hesitation that we were going to win.
1. When I was not obsessing about the trial I was obsessing about sales. A pair shipped, was a pair sold.
1. I was frustrated with our constant issues with supply. People wanted our shoes, but we could not get it to them in time.
1. No one knew how to boost the supply without taking a huge inventory risk. Puma and Adidas were having the same problems, but our problems could bankrupt us.
1. Sales rose to $4.8 million, but between legal troubles and supply and demand issues, we still might be out of business.
1. I had an idea of going to retailers and offering them a large discount if they made large nonrefundable orders. The program gained traction and retailers were desperate to be included. 
1. On September 13, 1973, my fifth wedding anniversary, our second son was born. 
1. When I found out Penny and the baby would be coming home after only 2 days, I asked if they could keep them an extra day. Oregon was playing Arizona State.

## 1974
1. April 14th, 1974, I was at the courthouse in downtown Portland. I offered to settle with Onitsuka, but he declined the offer. So, the trial began. Onitsuka's lawyers told the court how I cheated and lied.
1. Cousin Houser defended us in court even though his firm was against it. Nobody else wanted to represent us.
1. My mind wasn't clear at all. When I was called to the stand, I blew it. I felt myself sounding like a liar to the courtroom, and I was disappointed with myself. Cousin Houser and Strasser felt the same.
1. Our Judge was James Burns, also known as "James the Just". He was harsh, but we felt him leaning toward our side. People were talking about the case. Even the media.
1. Johnson was at a sports shop in Downtown Portland one afternoon and talked to a store manager about the case. The next morning, that store manager was on Onitsuka's side of the courtroom.
1. James the Just ordered a "cease and desist" to stop us from discussing the case.
1. One by one, everyone testified. Bowerman did not do well.
1. A foot doctor helped our case by explaining how different our shoes were from Onitsuka's. He tore them apart in front of everyone.
1. Woodell took the stand, but he could not stop laughing from nervousness.
1. Kitami asked for a translator. I knew he spoke perfect English.
1. After the case ended, we went to the bar. It did not look good. We returned to work as usual and waited to hear from the court.
1. Weeks later we got a call saying James the Just was going to make his ruling. We gathered in the courtroom. Blue Ribbon won! Onitsuka had to pay $400,000 to us for damages.
1. We did the formal signing for the money in San Francisco. Kitami did not bring a check. He looked ashamed and was ordered to mail it.
1. Rob Strasser came to the office and shared how much he will miss Blue Ribbon. I knew I wanted Strasser on my team after the case. I made a pitch to Strasser to join the team. He said he had to ask his dad. Soon his dad agreed, and Strasser became the first in-house lawyer for Blue Ribbon.
1. We had 2 weeks of peace, and then there was trouble. The value of the Japanese Yen collapsed. We had to look for another factory until the one in Taiwan was built.
1. We found an old factory in New Hampshire, and someone to produce the shoes. I asked Johnson to move back to the East Coast to manage it. We didn't have enough money to pay for it, so we borrowed from Nissho without telling them what it was for.
1. By the end of 1974, we were going to hit 8 million dollars in sales. To help, we got athletes to wear our shoes. Jimmy Connors, the famous tennis player, won Wimbledon and the U.S. open in our shoes. We were not able to promote him because he had gotten a better contract.

## 1975 (Part 1)
1. Every morning, I would chant: Pay Nissho first.
1. We were growing too fast, but I refused to order less inventory. Why would I order less? We always made just enough to pay for the shoes.
1. At the end of the month I paid Nissho all the money in the account, and started from zero.
1. Many people thought I was reckless, but I knew there was a large demand for shoes.
1. In 1975, we were too big for Sumergi, the creditor managing our account. Now the financial manager, Tadayuki Ito, would oversee us. We did not like him. I called him Ice Man.
1. Sometimes our bank account would be overdrawn, Hayes and I would have to go to the Bank of California and show
Holland our numbers. We told him how popular our shoes were, we just needed time to make payments. He said he was willing to work with us as long as we were honest.
1. Then, in the Spring of 1975, we owed Nissho $1 million. We didn't have enough money. We were $75,000 short.
1. We had to empty all of our accounts. We might not have enough money, but we have to figure out a way to pay Nissho.
1. Two days later, angry employees showed up at the factory in Exeter, New Hampshire. Their checks bounced. We were lucky Holland agreed to fix it.
1. Next thing I know, Holland called us to the bank. He said they no longer wanted to do business with Blue Ribbon. He was kicking us out.
1. I told Ice Man the bad news and that I needed another million dollars. He needed to look at our books before he gave us another cent.
1. Then, Holland called again. He told me the bank had to notify the FBI. They believed Blue Ribbon committed fraud. 
1. I told Penny. She had hope, but the thought of jail kept me up at night.
1. On Sunday afternoon, I gathered everyone for a conference. We decided Nissho was our last hope. We needed to play it right and be honest.
1. The men from Nissho were coming to visit soon. Ito would see we used a lot of their money to run a secret factory in Exeter. It would make them mad, or it would make them lose their minds.
1. Ito and Sumeragi arrived right on time to look at our books. When Ito found out about the Exeter factory, he actually smiled.
1. The next day, Sumergai pulled me aside. He had been trying to help. He was sending us invoices late. He thought it would give us more time to pay them. In reality, it looked like we had bad credit.
1. Sumeragi told Ito he was secretly helping Blue Ribbon. He said he did it because he believed in this company. It was his business child. I had no idea how Ito might respond.
1. Ito eventually believed that Sumeragi was working on his own. He forgave Blue Ribbon for the secret factory: There are worse things than ambition.
1. Holland and Ito met. Nissho paid off the full debt of Blue Ribbon. The FBI investigation was off. I thanked Ito.

## 1975 (Part 2)
1. We did not have time to celebrate our victory. We needed to find a new bank. Six banks hung up on us.
1. The seventh bank, First State Bank of Oregon in Milwaukie, told us to "Come on over." They loaned us $1 million dollars in credit.
1. I told Penny I needed the Memorial Day vacation. I also needed to watch Pre run. Always mixing work with pleasure.
1. Pre ran like usual. He did not seem his best at first, and then he finished strong and won the race.
1. We had to go home to the kids, so we could not celebrate with everyone after the race.
1. I woke up to a phone call from Campbell from the Bank of California in the middle of the night. I was confused. He told me Pre died.
1. I did not believe it. I just saw Pre run a race the same day. I hung up and called Hollister. He made a few phone calls and
called me back, sobbing. Pre was dead.
1. Pre was in a car accident after dropping off his friend after the party. Everyone swore he left the party sober.
1. Pre was only 24 years old when he died. That was the same age I was when Carter and I left for Hawaii.
1. Bowerman spoke at Pre's memorial service. He said Pre wanted so much more than to be the best runner in the world. I don't know how he got the words out.
1. I was told people were creating a shrine where Pre died. They brought flowers, letters, gifts, and Nikes.
1. I decided we needed to make an official memorial at Pre's rock. For things like this, Blue Ribbon would find a way to make it happen no matter the cost.

## 1976
1. I was finally reasonably sure of not going to jail. Now I could go back and ask myself, what are we trying to build here? What kind of company do we want to be?
1. Sony was the Apple of today. I often said I wanted to be like Sony. However, I still hoped for something bigger. Blue Ribbon was like my third child. I couldn't lose it.
1. Hayes, Woodell, Strasser and I agreed that money was not our end game. But, money was the only means to get there.
1. We needed more money than we had. Nissho was loaning us millions. We still needed more. We already had reached the legal limit of our new bank.
1. We talked about the most logical thing to do -- Go public. This was hard for me emotionally. This would mean working for stockholders or investment firms. We decided going public was not for us.
1. We applied for a million dollar loan from the First State Bank. Bowerman did not want to personally guarantee this loan. Since he retired, he didn't want to take any more risks.
1. Instead, Bowerman offered me two-thirds of his stake at Blue Ribbon, at a discounted price. I didn't want to lose him.
1. I begged Bowerman to keep a percentage and stay on as Vice President and a member of our small board. Deal, he said. We all shook hands.
1. People were loving the look of our shoes, especially the waffle trainer. People might start wearing these shoes to class. And the office. And the grocery store. And throughout their everyday lives.
1. I ordered the trainer in blue to go better with jeans. We couldn't make enough of these shoes. Nike was becoming a household word. We decided to change our name from Blue Ribbon to Nike, Inc.
1. We needed to ramp up production and find more manufacturing hubs outside of Japan. It was time to turn to Taiwan. For our point man in Taiwan, I looked to Jim Gorman. He was a loyal employee.
1. I'd need to give Gorman a crash course on Asia. I booked a trip to Taiwan, just the two of us.
1. On the flight, Gorman asked many questions. I told him that shoe producers are leaving Japan. The Japanese economy wasn't doing well. Companies were going to Korea and Taiwan.
1. Over the next week we toured two dozen factories. Most were dark and dirty. Just outside of Taichung, we found a factory called Feng Tay.
1. Feng tay was managed by a young man named C.H. Wong. He was a shoe dog. We noticed that one small room in the factory floor was off-limits. I asked what was in there. Home, he said. "That is where my wife and I and our three kids live."
1. Next, we flew to Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, and toured a few more factories. When we returned to our hotel, I got a phone call from Jerry Hsiech (pronounced Shay). He heard we were in the country and invited us to his office.
1. Jerry Hsiech talked about customs and superstitions about shoes around the world. He also shared his thoughts on the quality of shoes. He said to forget all the things that go into shoes, it's about the factory.
1. I sent Gorman home ahead of me. Before leaving Asia, I went to Manila to visit a shoe factory, a very good one. I spent the night in MacArthur's Suite at the Manila Hotel.
1. The 1976 Olympic trials were held again in Eugene. Now we had our top-quality shoes and spikes. I was hopeful we would have a Nike runner make an Olympic team.
1. As we took our seats in the bleachers we talked about Pre. He was on everyone else's mind too. We heard his name in every direction. His spirit was at the race. By the end of the night there were three Olympians in Nikes!
1. The next day we set up camp at the Nike store. Bowerman requested a meeting. Bowerman was upset he did not get products he needed in time. He felt he was no longer respected at Nike. I needed to find a way to make him feel needed and useful. If Bowerman isn't happy, I said, Nike isn't happy.
1. At the end of 1976 we doubled our sales - $14 million, but we still didn't have enough cash. We debated if we should go public. I brought it up at our gathering held every 6 months, a retreat we called Buttface.
1. Johnson came up with the term Buttface. At one of our first retreats, Johnson said, "How many multimillion-dollar companies can you yell out, 'Hey, Buttface,' and the entire team turns around?."
1. The only thing not tolerated at a Buttface was thin skin and sobriety.
1. When I returned home to Portland after a Buttface, Matthew and Travis would meet me at the door. They would ask, "Where have you been?" "Daddy was with his friends," I'd say picking them up. They'd stare, confused. "But Mommy told us you were working."
1. Nike just came out with its first children's shoes. Matthew said he would never wear Nikes as long as he lived. This was his way of expressing anger about me being away. Penny tried to make him understand that Daddy wasn't absent by choice.
1. Matthew seemed to resent me. Travis was always devoted. I often told myself, I will spend more time with the boys. I was only able to keep the promise for a short time and then I would fall back to my routine.
1. This was trickier than figuring out how to get shoes from Point A to Point B. I was figuring out how to keep Son A and Son B happy, while keeping Son C (Nike), afloat.

## 1977
1. Frank Rudy was a former aerospace engineer. We had a meeting that morning with him and his partner Bob Bogert.
1. They had a crazy idea. They figured out how to put air into a running shoe. I was unsure, so I asked if I could take them on a test run.
1. I ran 6 miles. The shoe soles were a little wobbly, but it was one heck of a ride. I told Strasser the air soles might be worth it.
1. We met with Rudy and Bogert to work out a deal. I let Strasser do the negotiating. After a couple weeks, the deal was settled.
1. Johnson met Rudy and also thought the air soles could be a big deal. His only worry was that the bubbles might cause blisters.
1. I gave Strasser an assignment to recruit college basketball teams to wear Nikes. After 3 years, the Oregon Ducks finally agreed to wear Nikes.
1. The next person who showed up on the Nike team was Sonny Vacarro. He claimed to know all the college basketball coaches. I sent him off with Strasser to recruit more teams.
1. One month later, we had a bunch of teams who signed with Nike: Texas, University of Nevada, South Carolina, and many more. A year or two later, we did the same with college football coaches.
1. We weren't doing so well with Tennis deals. In 1977, I decided to go to Wimbledon to change that.
1. It started to become harder to meet customer demands. We decided to sign a contract with a company in Korea. This ended our dependence on Japan.
1. The boss of our new advertising company, John Brown created an ad for Nike. It focused on the spirit of the product instead of the shoe. I wasn't so sure I believed in it.
1. I decided to ask Chuck Robinson for some business advice. He said we should go public. I mentioned it to the team, but we all had different opinions about it.
1. Then, a bill came from Washington DC. It said we owed $25 million dollars. Converse and Keds were behind it.
1. There was no way we could pay them the money. I told Strasser we needed to fight this with everything we've got. 
1. I was having trouble holding in my anger. I was either silent or in rage. Eventually, I decided I needed to figure out a way to relax: run, count backwards, meditate.
1. I also wanted to be a better father. I was spending so much time away from the boys.
1. One night, my father told me something shocking had happened on TV. There was a fight between the Lakers and Rockets. A player, Tomjanovich, fell to the floor in pain but the cameraman kept zooming in on his Nike swoosh.
1. In 1977, we made nearly $70 million dollars, so Penny and I decided to buy a new house. I liked to act like the fight with the government was not happening.
1. In the new house, I wanted a new routine. I started spending more time with the boys. I was going to their basketball games, soccer games, and playing with them in the yard.
1. Slowly, the boys realized they no longer wanted to do sports. I felt sad. My whole life was about sports, and neither of them wanted to share this with me.

## 1978
1. Our rage was not enough in the fight against the U.S. Customs. Strasser brought in his friend named Richard Werschukl. Richard had good credentials: Stanford University undergrad, University of Oregon Law.
1. Richard had a warm, fascinating personality. He was also sarcastic. While he could be very witty, even silly, he could change on a dime and become very serious.
1. Nothing made Richard more serious than our lawsuit, Nike vs. U.S. Customs. Some worried about Richard's seriousness. They feared it bordered on obsession. Fine by me, I thought. 4. Strasser had the idea to promote Richard and move him to Washington, D.C. He would be closer to the politicians that we needed on our side.
1. Hayes wanted to buy a rubber mill. He said it would help us do a better job of controlling the quality of our outer soles and midsoles.
1. With my permission, Hayes and Woodell purchased a nonworking factory. They thought it would be good for storage until we could get it working.
1. We were on track to make $140 million dollars in 1979. Our quality was also rising at the same pace. People thanked us for making a shoe that was better than Adidas. I thought they were late to the party.
1. We outgrew our headquarters again. We moved to a 40,000 square foot building in Beaverton.
1. In my office, I had a leather chair that was a giant baseball mitt. I took in the humor and the irony. Getting cut from my high school baseball team had been one of the great hurts of my life. Now I was sitting in a giant  mitt, in my fancy new office.
1. At the final Buttface of 1978, I announced that we needed to start selling clothes. We had to keep up with the competition. I put Ron Nelson in charge of it.
1. During one of my first meetings with Nelson, I noticed he had absolutely no sense of style. He was the worst dresser I ever met. I started paying more attention to what I wore, and what those around me wore.
1. Most of my staff did not dress professionally. We had to impress bankers and investors. So, I started a company dresscode. This was not taken well. Corporate bullshit, many grumbled.
1. Strasser started dressing worse. After another reminder, I had to fine him. I instructed the bookkeeper to take $75 from his paycheck.
1. Strasser and Hayes rebelled again days later. I ordered them to both go home and dress like adults.
1. I turned and saw Nelson. He was dressed worse. I pointed at the door and sent him home too. He looked confused and horrified. I realized he wasn't protesting. He was just naturally unstylish.
1. A few weeks later, Nelson presented the first-ever line of Nike apparel. Nelson pulled each item from a dirty brown paper bag. At first we were shocked. Finally, someone chuckled and then we all laughed. I transferred Nelson to the production department to use his accounting skills.
1. We began selling a new shoe called the Tailwind. It was the work of M. Frank Rudy's patented air soles. Everyone flew out to Hawaii for the launch. Then, complaints came in.
1. The Tailwind had a design flaw. We issued a recall. This was a blow to everyone's confidence. We learned not to put 12 innovations into one shoe.
1. The factories in Taiwan and Korea were doing well. We opened new factories in England and Ireland. Industry watchers thought we were unstoppable. Not many people knew we were broke.
2. Richard was in Washington D.C. doing everything we asked of him. He was speaking with a lot of politicians. 
1. The politicians asked for evidence in writing. He spent weeks writing a breakdown of the company. In the process, he suffered a breakdown.
1. Richard wrote an exhaustive history of the company that was hundreds of pages. I thought it should've been called The Decline and Fall of the Nike Empire. Richard called it Wershchkul on American Selling Price, Volume I.
1. I sent Strasser to check on Richard. That first night they went to a bar. Richard got up on the table and delivered his speech, "Give me Nike or give me death!"
1. Strasser tried to calm Richard, but he couldn't. I knew that I would have to start flying to Washington D.C. I had to take on this fight myself.

## 1979
1. I went to the Treasury Department in Washington D.C. I looked at the man who kept sending us bills for $25 million. He looked like a beady-eyed bureaucrat.
1. I couldn't figure out which creature he reminded me of. Then I remembered Johnson's pet octopus, Stretch. Yes! This bureaucrat was a kraken. A micro-kraken. A bureau-kraken!
1. I tried to convince the bureau-kraken it was a misunderstanding. He interrupted me. He told me he didn't care what I said, or what I thought. He didn't care if this was "fair," or "American." He made air quotes with his bony
fingers. He just wanted his money. "His money?!," I thought.
1. I began kissing up. I told him I understood he has a job to do. Then, I told him that if Nike was forced to pay the a huge sum of money, it would put us out of business. "So?" he said. "Do what you gotta do. Good day," the bureau-kraken said and then turned back to his files. 
1. I began commuting to Washington D.C. every month to meet with politicians and anyone who could help. I read everything about customs. Nothing was working.
1. Late in the summer, Richard got me an appointment with one of Oregon's senators, Mark O. Hatfield. We thought he was our last shot. Hayes, Woodell, and I prepared for any argument he may throw at us.
1. The next morning we walked slowly up the steps of the U.S. Senate Office Building. We were led into Hatfield's office. He asked how he could help. We were not prepared for him to be so helpful. We told him we would have to get back to him.
1. I flew home in time to join the opening of a new store in downtown Portland. The lines at the cash registers were endless. I had to jump in and help. For a moment it felt like I was in my parents' living room, measuring feet, fitting runners with the right shoes.
1. We needed even more office space and moved offices again. We found a 46,000 square foot building. Everyone came for beer and pizza and helped move.
1. In the fall I flew to Washington for a second meeting with the bureau-kraken. This time he wasn't as feisty. Hatfield contacted him. He told me he was tired of hearing from my "high-placed friends". I told him he would until this situation is resolved.
1. With the bureau-kraken rattled that Hatfield reached out to him, I could focus on production. It was time to think of factories in China. We wanted to be the first ones in.
1. We had one China expert on our team, Chuck. Chuck connected us with David Chang. Chang knew China very well.
1. The Chang Dynasty at Nike didn't start well. He was preppy. I took him around the office to introduce him to everyone. He had a talent for saying the wrong thing. He had a terrible sense of humor.

## 1980
1. We had a conference with Chang. He warned that it was extremely difficult to set up a factory in China. The Chinese government needed to invite us. 
1. We sent off a written presentation to Beijing. We did not think it would work out. 
1. At the first Buttface of 1980, I decided we were going to make a really cheap shoe, called the One Line. Then we released a commercial about how our small company was fighting the "big bad government." The people were on our side. 
1. Then, we filed a lawsuit against our competitors for $25 million dollars. They gave up. We started to figure out an agreement. I refused to pay a single penny. 
1. In the springtime, I settled the deal and wrote our competitors a check for $9 million dollars. 
1. People began to ask if we were still going public. I was scared to lose control. Chuck told me about a plan that would keep me and the rest of the founders in control of the company. I decided to go for it. 
1. In the summer, we received a letter from the Chinese government. They accepted our request to visit. Chang, Strasser, and Hayes went on the trip. 
1. We stopped in Japan on our way to China. I was reminded of my Crazy Idea to start a shoe company back in 1962. 
1. For 12 days, we traveled around China. We also visited the factories. They were filthy. 
1. One of our last stops was to the Ministry of Sports. They made all the deals for Chinese Athletes. We made a deal with them. In 2 years, Chinese Olympians would be 
1. We became the first American shoemaker to be allowed to do business with China in 25 years. 
1. We figured out the stock shares when we returned. I would ultimately still be the boss of the company. 
1. We went around to multiple cities to promote our company to bankers. We decided to sell our shares for twenty-two dollars. We deserved that much. The market accepted our price. 
1. That night, I read the boys a story before bed. Then Penny and I sat in front of the TV. I felt different. I felt regret. I wished I could do it all over again. 
15. I was now worth $178 million dollars. 

## Night
1. It’s Christmas time, 2007. Penny and I picked out a movie to go see, The Bucket List with Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. We thought this movie was a comedy, but it was far from that. 
1. The theater was in Palm Springs. We spend a lot of time here, hiding from the chilly Oregon rains. Walking through the lobby we see Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. 
1. I wanted to know what was on their bucket lists. I nearly ask, but don’t. Gates and Buffet have done everything they’ve ever wanted in this life. They have no bucket lists, surely. Which makes me ask myself: Have I? 
1. I spend long stretches of the day thinking about my childhood. I think a lot about my grandfather, Bump Knight. 
1. Bump did not start with much. He saved to buy a brand new Model T and moved his wife and five children to Minnesota, Colorado, and then Oregon. He told me that he didn’t bother to get his driver’s license, he just up and went.
1. Bump later bought a pickup. He loved putting us grandkids in the back of it and driving into town. He’d always stop and buy us each a dozen glazed donuts. 
1. I often see myself, dangling my bare feet over his truck bed, feeling the fresh wind on my face, licking glaze off a warm donut. 
1. I ask myself, could I have risked this much and taken so many chances, without the early foundation of that feeling? Without feeling safety and happiness? I don’t think so. 
1. After 40 years I stepped down as Nike CEO. There are 5,000 employees at the world headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. 
1. As chairman, most days I still go to my office. I don’t see buildings, I see temples. On the buildings and along walkways there are banners of the super athletes. These people have elevated Nike to something more than a brand. Jordan. Kobe. Tiger. 
1. I thought of my trip around the world. The River Jordan. Mystical Kobe, Japan. That first meeting with Onitsuka, asking executives for the right to sell Tigers… Can this all be a coincidence? 
1. I always feel a thrill, a shot of adrenaline, when I drive through the Nike campus. The streets are named after the Nike team. I also take great pleasure in strolling past the oasis at the center of campus, the Nissho Iwai Japanese Gardens. 
1. Our campus is a map of Nike’s history and growth; and also a picture of my life. The campus is also an expression of Gratitude. 
1. I sit at my recliner, watching Penny needlepoint. The mental images come tumbling faster and faster. As if I’m needlepointing memories. 
1. I watch Pete Sampras crush at one of his many Wimbledons. After the final point he tossed his racket to me and missed. He hit the man behind me, who sued, of course. 
1. I smile as Tiger drains the final putt at Augusta-or is it St. Andrews? He hugs me - and holds on for many seconds longer than I expect. 
1. I think about the moments I’ve shared with him, and with Bo Jackson, and with Michael Jordan. 
1. These guys are like sons and brothers -- family. I was invited to Tiger’s father’s funeral. There were less than 100 guests. When Jordan’s father was murdered, I flew to North Carolina for the funeral. I was shocked to see that a seat was reserved for me in the front row. 
1. All of this leads me back to Matthew. I think of his long, hard search for meaning, for identity. For me. His search often looked so familiar, even though Matthew didn’t have my luck, or my focus. Nor my insecurity. Maybe if he’d had a little more insecurity… 
1. In his search to find himself, Matthew dropped out of college. He experimented, rebelled, argued, ran away. Nothing worked. Then, at last, in 2000, he seemed to enjoy being a husband, a father, a philanthropist. 
1. Matthew got involved in Mi Casa, Su Casa, a charity building an orphanage in El Salvador. 
1. On one of his visits there, he drove with two friends to a deep-water lake, to go scuba diving. He decided to see how deep he could go. He took a risk that even his risk-addicted father would never take. 
1. Something went wrong. At 150 feet my son lost consciousness. After the thousands of miles I’ve logged as a runner, I know that feeling of fighting for that next breath. But I won’t let my imagination go there, ever. 
1. When diving goes wrong, I’ve learned that a diver often feels something called “the martini effect.” He thinks everything is okay. Better than okay. He feels euphoric. 
1. That must have happened to Matthew, I tell myself, because at the last second he pulled out his mouthpiece. I choose to believe this euphoria scenario, to believe that my son didn’t suffer at the end. That my son was happy. I choose, because it’s the only way I can go on. 
1. Penny and I were at the movies when we found out about Matthew. Travis came and got us. The next morning, the news was everywhere. Every single Nike athlete wrote, emailed, and phone. 
1. In my father’s final six months, we traveled around the world. I put to rest the question of whether he was proud, to show him that I was proud of him. 
1. We saw Nikes in every country we visited. With every appearance of a swoosh his eyes shone. The pain of his impatience and hostility to my Crazy Idea had faded. It was long gone. But not the memory. 
1. I thought of the phrase, “It’s just business.” It’s never just business. It never will be. If it ever does become just business, that will mean that business is very bad. 
1. I think of others who didn’t make it this far. Bowerman died on Christmas Eve, 1999. Strasser died suddenly of a heart attack in 1993. He was so young, it was a tragedy. Even more so because we had a falling out. We clashed too many times. He quit and went to work for Adidas. 
1. I felt that Strasser working for Adidas was a betrayal. I never forgave him. Though, I proudly hired his daughter, Avery. I wish Strasser and I could have patched things up. 
1. I felt the same betrayal when Nike was blamed for conditions in our overseas factories - the sweatshop controversy. Reporters never included how hard we worked with our factory partners to make them safer and cleaner. These factories weren’t even ours. We rented them. They knew our name would generate the most publicity.
1. I felt angry. I thought I was creating jobs and helping poor countries as well as helping athletes do their best. We knew we could do better, though. We became the leader in the factory reform movement. Now, Nike is the gold standard by which we measure all clothing and shoe factories. 
1. There will always be the concern about wages. The salary of a Third World factory worker seems impossibly low to Americans, and I understand. We have to operate within the limits of each country and economy. One country, which shall be nameless, told us we were disrupting the nation’s economic system by paying a shoe worker more than a medical doctor. Change never comes as fast as we want it. 
1. Harvard and Stanford began studying Nike. They shared the research with other universities, which has created many opportunities for me to visit different colleges. 
1. I find students today are much smarter and competent than in my time. I also find them far more pessimistic. Occasionally they ask: “Where is the U.S. going? Where is the world going? Or: “Are we doomed as a society to a worse future for our children?” 
1. I tell the students about the devastated Japan I saw in 1962. I tell them about the amazing people I knew in Japan, despite the devastation. I tell them about the many resources we have to solve these crises. 
1. Hayes lives in Tualatin Valley, with a collection of bulldozers. Woodell lives in Oregon with his wife. The original $8,000 loan from Woodell’s family to Phil was now worth $1.6 million. 
1. I bought a Porsche. I tried to buy the Los Angeles Clippers, and wound up in a lawsuit. 
1. It took us a while to get used to the fame. I wore sunglasses everywhere. Soon we were back to normal. 
1. I can’t sleep. I can’t stop thinking about The Bucket List. There’s a few things I still want to do. Help a couple of universities change the world. Help find a cure for cancer. 
1. Of course, I regret not spending more time with my sons. Maybe if I have, I could have understood Matthew better. This regret clashes with my secret regret that I can’t do it all over again. 
1. I wish I could relive the whole thing. It is important to share the experience, the ups and downs, so that others going through the same trials might be inspired or comforted. Or warned. 
1. I’d tell them to hit pause, think about how they want to spend their time, and with whom they want to spend it for the next forty years. 
1. Luck plays a big role. Everyone gets lucky, athletes, poets, businesses. Hard work, a good team, and determination are critical, but luck may decide the outcome. 
1. Some people might call it Tao, or Logos, or Dharma. Or Spirit. Or God. Have faith in yourself, but also have faith infaith. Not faith as others define it. Faith as you define it. Faith as faith defines itself in your heart. 
1. In what format do I want to say all this? A memoir? A novel or a speech? So maybe there is something on my bucket list after all? Another Crazy Idea. 
1. Suddenly, my mind was racing. I need to find copies of letters and my old slides. I have so many things to learn about my own life. 
1. I grab a yellow legal pad from my desk and sit in my recliner. A feeling of stillness and peace comes over me.
