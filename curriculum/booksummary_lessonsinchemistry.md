# Lessons in Chemistry By Bonnie Garmus 
## Chapter 1: November 1961 
1. In 1961, women wore long-sleeved dresses, joined garden clubs, and raised kids. Nobody knew there would be a ‘60s movement. 
1. After the big wars, people felt fresh and believed everything was possible. That was not the case for Elizabeth Zott, a 30-year-old mother. 
1. Elizabeth woke up every morning and was sure of one thing: her life was over. 
1. Elizabeth went to the kitchen to make her daughter Madeline lunch. On a note, she wrote, “Fuel for learning.” She paused, “Play sports at recess, but do not automatically let the boys win.” She paused again and wrote, “It is not your imagination. Most people are awful.” 
1. Madeline was a gifted child. She learned to read at three. She could hum a Bach concerto. She was that kind of child. She could explain the earth’s movement but not tie her shoes. 
1. This was Madeline’s problem. Children gifted in music are often celebrated, but early readers are not. Everyone learns to read. So being first isn’t special - it’s just annoying. 
1. Madeline knew this. Every morning, she took the notes from her lunch and put them in a shoebox in her closet. At school, she pretended she didn’t know how to read. 
1. To Madeline, fitting in with other kids was so important. Her mother never fit in. Look what happened to her.
1. Elizabeth and Madeline live in the Southern California town of Commons. 
1. Madeline lay in bed, waiting for her mom's gentle kiss on her forehead. 
1. Then, Madeline heard her mom’s car drive away to the television studio.
1. At the studio, Elizabeth would put on an apron and walk out onto the set. The show was called Supper at Six, and Elizabeth Zott was a star. 
## Chapter 2: Pine 
1. Elizabeth was a research chemist until she became a TV star. Food theft led to her discovery as a TV star. 
1. Most of Madeline’s classmates ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch. Elizabeth packed Madeline a tasty lunch of lasagna, zucchini, chopped kiwi, cherry tomatoes, and a salt shaker. Everyone wanted Madeline’s lunch. 
1. Madeline gave her lunch away every day to a girl named Amanda Pine. Madeline chose Amanda because she was the only one in the school who didn’t make fun of her. 
1. Elizabeth noticed Madeline losing weight. As a scientist, Elizabeth wanted an explanation. She calculated what her daughter needed to be healthy. Weight loss was not possible. 
1. Elizabeth met Amanda Pine and saw the tomato sauce on her lips. Elizabeth then figured out who ate Madeline’s food.
1. Elizabeth called for Mr. Pine as she walked into the local TV studio. “I’ve been calling you for three days,” she said. She then continued explaining his daughter was eating Madeleine's food. 
1. Walter Pine was confused. He stood and took in the glowing woman wearing a white lab coat in front of him. Elizabeth was tall and stiff with beautiful blonde hair tied up using a pencil. She stood with her hands on her hips. 
1. As a long-time TV producer, Walter knew drama. But this? She was stunning. He was literally stunned by her. Was she auditioning for something? 
1. Elizabeth explained why she was there. Walter finally understood who she was. Walter said that he and Mrs. Pine are divorced. 
1. Elizabeth explained that she had no time to make Walter’s daughter’s lunch.
1. Then Elizabeth said, “Does anyone have the time to teach the entire country to make food that matters? I wish I did, but I don’t. Do you?” 
1. Elizabeth wasn’t sure about the idea. She was a research chemist. She took the job because it paid more, and she had a child to support. 
1. Supper at Six aired on TV four weeks later.
1. From the first day on set, Elizabeth had the “it” factor. 
1. People didn’t know what to make of her. Elizabeth Zott was serious. She never made jokes. Her dishes were as honest and down-to-earth as she was. 
1. By 6 months, Elizabeth was a rising star. Her recipes were nutritious and hearty. She made stews and casseroles all in under an hour. 
1. People would say that when Elizabeth Zott finished cooking, an entire nation sat down to eat.
1. She ended every show with the line: “Children, set the table. Your mother needs a moment to herself.” 
1. A reporter called Elizabeth “Luscious Lizzie.” The nickname quickly stuck. 
1. Strangers called Elizabeth “Luscious.” Madeline knew this nickname belittled her mother. 
1. Elizabeth would lay in bed at night and wonder how her life came to this. She already knew. His name was Calvin Evans.  
## Chapter 3: Hastings Research Institute 
1. Calvin Evans worked at Hastings. He had a large lab all to himself. 
1. Elizabeth accepted work at Hastings because it was the only offer she received. 
1. Calvin was brilliant but had a habit of holding grudges and being impatient. 
1. Calvin also had a passion for rowing. 
1. Calvin wasn’t the best at dating, either. He was like a dog who finally catches a squirrel but doesn’t know what to do with it. Part of his problem was his looks. He looked lonely. 
1. When he fell in love with Elizabeth Zott, he began to smile all the time. 
1. Elizabeth went down to Cavin’s lab to ask for beakers. He told her to send her boss. He wanted to talk to a chemist, not a “secretary.” 
1. Elizabeth did not have time to deal with him. “What a coincidence! I’m busy, too!” She took his beakers.
1. A week later, Calvin tracked down Elizabeth. She seemed not to remember him. She said, “Do you mind? Now I’m in the middle of something important.” 
1. Calvin came to apologize. When he asked her out, she declined. She said, “You should know you’re starting to annoy me.” Calvin left. 
1. A lab tech asked if that was Calvin Evans. He said Elizabeth should not have taken his beakers. Calvin is famous for holding a grudge. 
1. Elizabeth holds grudges, too. She holds grudges about men who belittle women. 
1. The next day, the beakers were gone. She heard coworkers talking about her. “She’s not even that smart. Someone should put her in her place.” 
1. Two years ago, Elizabeth was a Master’s student at UCLA. She was close to graduation. 
1. She was in the lab late one night. She heard the door open. She wasn’t expecting anyone. 
1. Her mentor, Dr. Meyers, opened the door. He was one of the top DNA researchers in the United States, but no one liked him. 
1. Every day, Elizabeth dealt with inappropriate comments from him. She needed her degree. 
1. Myers called Elizabeth into his office. Elizabeth was in the lab, double-checking her supervisor’s work. She questioned the research protocol.
1. Myers shoved his hand up her skirt. She said she was going to report him. He turned to the door and locked it. 
1. Myers slapped her. She gasped. He hit her again. 
1. Myers grabbed her hips. Elizabeth fought back. She stabbed him in the stomach with a #2 pencil. 
1. Elizabeth reported the attack to the campus police. They didn’t believe her. 
1. Dr. Meyers said the attack was Elizabeth’s fault. The Admissions Office did not believe him, but he was important. UCLA needed him. 
1. This was the end of Elizabeth’s academic career.
1. At Hastings, Elizabeth was moved to a low-level project for no good reason. 
1. Elizabeth bought herself a ticket to a funny operetta. Coincidentally, Calvin Evans was there too. He left his date and ran into Elizabeth in the lobby. He vomited all over her dress. 
1. She helped him home. He apologized multiple times. “No need to apologize. We’re scientists. We understand these things.” 
1. He clarified. He apologized for assuming she was a secretary the other day. 
1. Next week, they talked chemistry over coffee. 
1. Elizabeth explained her boss, Donatti, took her off the team because of sexual discrimination.
1. More women wanted to be in science, but they were denied education. 
1. Evans offered to use her research and get her back on the team. She reluctantly accepted. 
1. This is work. That’s it. They agreed, but secretly hoped they both did not mean it. 
## Chapter 4: Introduction to Chemistry 
1. As Calvin and Elizabeth left the parking lot after a date, they argued about covalent bonds. 
1. Every date was the high and low of Calvin’s day. He loved seeing her but hated when she left. 
1. Elizabeth explained there had been recent silkworm findings. He pretended to listen. Why was she talking about worms? 
1. What a huge disappointment. She thought she found someone she could talk with. He seemed to have no interest in her. 
1. Calvin wasn’t listening because he was distracted by his own thoughts. The smell of her hair was intoxicating. 
1. Elizabeth felt rejected and depressed. She was falling in love with him. 
1. As she left, Calvin motioned her to roll down her window. 
1. They looked at each other face to face. This time, she did it. They kissed. 
1. It was a permanent bond even chemistry could not explain.
## Chapter 5: Family Values 
1. People at Hastings thought Elizabeth was dating Calvin for fame. Elizabeth and Calvin seemed to fit perfectly. 
1. They lay together at night and talked for hours. One night, Calvin asked Elizabeth about her Thanksgiving plans. 
1. Elizabeth said, “I’m not going home. I thought we might have Thanksgiving here. Together. Unless. Were you planning on going home?” “Absolutely not,” he said. 
1. Over the last few months, they had talked about everything except family. Now, they had a chance to share. Calvin grew up in Iowa, and Elizabeth grew up in Oregon. 
1. Calvin continued to share about his childhood. He told her about his parents, who died in a car accident when he was five. They were hit by a train. 
1. Calvin then went to live with his aunt. She died in a car accident when he was six. 
1. Elizabeth squeezed her eyes shut when he told her, “And then you were put in a….” “A Catholic boys' home,” Calvin finished her sentence. His tone became dark.
1. “You were saying, Oregon?” Calvin continued. “Yes,” Elizabeth described her father as a God salesman. “Someone who preaches gloom and doom to make money.” 
1. “My father is the one who introduced me to chemistry,” Elizabeth said, “He would create a fire using pistachios when he needed a convenient sign from God.” 
1. Calvin tried to hide he was sad not to meet her family. He hoped to sit around a table with a family at Thanksgiving. 
1. “Where’s your brother?” Calvin asked. Elizabeth said, “He hanged himself. John was gay. My father told him God hated him.” Elizabeth was 10 years old, and John was 17 at the time. 
1. Calvin did not understand. He knew people counted on family to get through hard times. He did not realize that family could be the hard time. 
1. Elizabeth said, “While we may be born into families, it doesn’t mean we belong to them. People like my father speak of love but are filled with hate.” 
1. They lay silently, both feeling the hurt of their pasts. “Where are your parents now?” Calvin asked. “My father is in prison. One of his signs from God ended up killing 3 people. My mother divorced, remarried, and moved to Brazil. Did I mention my parents never paid taxes?” 
1. “So after your brother…died…it was just you and your parents?” Calvin asked. “No, just me. My parents were gone for weeks at a time. I taught myself to cook and do small house repairs.”
1. Elizabeth had not gone to school. Instead, she spent her time in the library like she always used to do with her brother. 
1. “When I was a kid, I used to tell myself every day was new. Anything could happen.”, Calvin said. 
1. Elizabeth thought he must have been brave as an orphaned boy. He endured the worst and still decided the next day might be better. 
1. The family memories were too much for him, and he stopped talking. “Let’s call it a day,” Calvin said. Off to bed, they went.
## Chapter 6: The Hastings Cafeteria 
1. To some researchers at Hastings Research Institute, Elizabeth and Calvin had an “unfair share of happiness.” Most people thought they had not earned their share of joy. They thought Elizabeth and Calvin were born that way. 
1. “Here they come,” said one person sitting in the cafeteria. Elizabeth and Calvin sat down at a table. Elizabeth opened their Tupperware of home-cooked food. 
1. They shared work ideas as their colleagues watched and talked about them. “Evans was nominated for the Nobel Prize again,” one of them said. Everyone at the table sighed. 
1. “She’s got Calvin Evans. Why is she still here?... unless Evans doesn’t want to marry her,” one of the geologists said. Another geologist said, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” 
1. Elizabeth excused herself from lunch to go to a meeting. “If you worked in my lab, you’d never have to go to meetings," Calvin told Elizabeth. 
1. Elizabeth was an entry-level chemist. She had to make her way. She explained this to Calvin more than once.
1. “We live together. This is the next step,” Calvin said. “That was a financial decision,” Elizabeth reminded Calvin. 
1. Calvin wanted to marry Elizabeth. Elizabeth had made it clear that she did not want to get married. Calvin couldn’t help but buy a ring anyway. He kept the tiny box in his pocket, waiting for the right time. 
1. They spent most of their time together, so sharing a living space made sense. But in 1952, an unmarried woman did not move in with a man. Elizabeth said she would pay half, but Calvin knew she couldn’t pay even a quarter. 
1. Hastings paid her about half of what a man in her position made. Calvin knew this because he peeked at her file. Elizabeth offered a trade. “I’ll make dinner 5 nights a week,” Elizabeth said. 
1. They moved in together, and it all worked out. But she wouldn’t consider working in his lab. 
1. “I want to be judged on my work. Not work people think you did for me,” Elizabeth explained to Calvin. 
1. Sitting in the cafeteria, Elizabeth said, “I have a meeting. A dress fitting for a friend’s wedding,” 
1. “Wait. You have a friend?” Calvin asked. Calvin thought she only had work friends. 
1. “Well, yes. Margaret and I have talked to each other in the hallways. One of her bridesmaids is sick,'' Elizabeth said. As she said this, she realized Margaret was only looking for a size 6 without weekend plans. 
1. Calvin said, “I love weddings. I’ll go with you.” Calvin hated weddings. He thought Elizabeth might change her mind about marriage if they were both close to an altar. 
1. Calvin reached into his pocket and placed the ring box in front of her. Other researchers and workers began to look. “I know your thoughts on marriage,” Calvin said as he tried to persuade her. 
1. Elizabeth turned him down. “I can’t risk having my scientific contributions hidden under your name," Elizabeth said. 
1. Elizabeth said, “I’m fully committed to you. Marriage will not change that. Everything I do will suddenly be in your name. Most people will assume you’ve done it simply because you’re a man, especially because you’re Calvin Evans.” Elizabeth said. 
1. Calvin said, “Please understand. I want us to be a real family. It’s important to me, maybe because I lost my family. Ever since I met you, I’ve felt there should be three of us. You, me, and a… a…”
1. Elizabeth’s eyes narrowed in horror. “I thought we agreed about that, too!” Elizabeth said. 
1. “I was only thinking that we could get a dog, "Calvin said. Elizabeth breathed a sigh of relief. Calvin leaned over to kiss her. 
1. Colleagues watched in every direction. Their silverware fell onto trays, chairs were kicked back, and napkins were squeezed into balls. It was the sound of jealousy.
## Chapter 7: Six-Thirty
1. Saturday evening, about a month later, Elizabeth walked to the local store to get something for dinner. On her way home, a dog followed her. Calvin saw them walking toward the house from the window. “Elizabeth Zott, you’re going to change the world,”  Calvin thought. Here, she had her first follower. 
1. “Who’s your friend?” Calvin asked. “It’s six thirty,” she said after looking at her wrist. The dog’s name became Six-Thirty. Six-Thirty was tall, gray, slim, and very dirty. 
1. Calvin and Elizabeth tried to find Six-Thirty’s owners. They posted a listing in the newspaper and called the local shelter. No one claimed him. 
1. Six Thirty was a fast learner. Elizabeth thought he was an unusual dog. He learned over five tricks in a couple of weeks. Later, they found out why he was in the alley. 
1. Six-Thirty had been at a canine bomb-sniffer trainee camp. He failed miserably. He never seemed to sniff out the bomb in time. He also had to witness the praise upon German shepherds who did. His handler drove him to the highway and dumped him in the middle of nowhere. Two weeks later, he found his way to Elizabeth. 
1. On Monday morning, they took Six-Thirty to work with them. Miss Frask tried to tell Calvin he could not bring their dog to work. “No one’s complained to me,” Calvin said, even though he knew no one would dare. 
1. Within a few weeks, Six-Thirty learned the whole campus. He was on high alert around Elizabeth. He could sense that she’d suffered in her past. He could sense it and was determined she should never suffer again. Elizabeth also felt the need to protect Six-Thirty. 
1. Although the agreement for rent was dinner five nights a week, Elizabeth was cooking breakfast, then lunch. Elizabeth saw cooking as chemistry.  Elizabeth cracked eggs into a bowl and spoke to Six-Thirty as he watched. “Now I’m disrupting the egg’s internal bonds to make the amino acid chain longer,” she told him. 
1. Calvin did a workout video as Elizabeth cooked. This gave him the idea to teach Elizabeth to row. She wasn’t interested. Calvin tried his best to convince her. Finally, Elizabeth said, “Women don’t row.” As soon as she said this, she regretted it. The next day, they woke up at 4:30 in the morning and went to the boathouse. 
1. Calvin led Elizabeth and Six-Thirty into the boathouse. It smelled like mildew and sweat. Calvin placed the rowing machine in the bay and began teaching Elizabeth to row. Within minutes of heavy breathing, he seemed to forget Elizabeth was there. 
1. She snuck away and looked around the boathouse. She looked at trophies and photographs. She saw a picture of a small framed man. He was the coach. 
1. Elizabeth watched from a distance as people entered the boathouse. Each person nodded to Calvin. She noticed how much people respected him here, too. 
1. Calvin continued to row in his one person boat as another team practiced. The coach began to yell at Calvin in a shocking way. As the coach cussed at Calvin and told him to row harder, Elizabeth noticed a look in his face she had never seen before. Elizabeth grew concerned for Calvin. 
1. After rowing, Calvin introduced Elizabeth to everyone in the boathouse. They questioned her rowing skills. Calvin assured them that she already has what it takes to be a great rower. Elizabeth’s interest grew when she heard there’s a women’s team. 
## Chapter 8: Overraching
1. The first day on the water, her and Calvin flipped the pair. She forgot to tell him she couldn’t swim.
1. They kept getting back on the water. They continued to have the worst of days.
1. Calvin forgot to tell her the pair is the hardest boat to row. He couldn’t let her on the bigger boat because she would ruin the row. She was female and had no experience.
1. Calvin told her “go slow to go fast.”
1. Calvin told Elizabeth her problem was physics…not team work. She was relieved.
## Chapter 9: The Grudge 
1. When Calvin said he held no grudges and hated no one, he was lying. Only one man he swore to hate until his dying day. 
1. He first saw the man when he was ten. He came in a long limo and only had a briefcase. After he came, we received new textbooks. 
1. Some of the pages were missing: Evolution. 
1. Calvin kept getting sent to the office. The bishop told him they wouldn’t be in this mess if it weren’t for his father. 
1. Calvin’s adoptive parents had died in a train wreck. His real father was the man with the briefcase. When the bishop showed the man a picture of Calvin, he lost interest: “Just so you know, your real mother died in childbirth and your real father couldn’t cope.”
1. The bishop continued, “The good thing is, he did leave a chunk of change for you and the rest of the boys. We agreed you would do better being schooled here anyway.” 
1. The only thing that ever showed up were more science books. He still held on to hope, as children do. He was determined to uncover the chemistry he and his father shared. 
1. Chemistry itself created the grudge he could neither hide nor outgrow.
## Chapter 10: The Leash 
1. Elizabeth was not quite convinced Six-Thirty was not human. That’s why she didn’t buy him a leash. He rarely strayed far from her side, except when a firecracker exploded right in front of him. 
1. When the city passed its first leash law, she bought one and hung it on the coat rack. Calvin didn’t notice. 
1. Calvin laughed at the law when Elizabeth told him: “That doesn’t apply to us. We pass the precinct everyday. The police know us.” 
1. Elizabeth replied, “Something could happen. He could get hit by a car. Remember the firecracker?” 
1. Calvin smiled. It was a side of Elizabeth he had not seen: a mothering instinct. 
1. There was lightning in the forecast as well. Dr.Mason let him know rowing was canceled. Elizabeth tried not to act relieved. 
1. “Did he say anything else?” Elizabeth asked. 
1. “We’re in the lineup for next week. He wants us to consider a race in the Spring. You’ll love it.”
1. Calvin was pretty sure she would not love it. 
1. “Sounds interesting,” she lied. 
1. Calvin sensed Elizabeth getting dressed in the dark at 4am. He reminded her that rowing was canceled. 
1. “I can’t sleep. I think I’ll go to work early,” she said. 
1. He motioned for her to get back into bed. One hour later, he woke up alone with a note on the table that read: Enjoy the potatoes. See you soon -xoxox E 
1. That morning he ran to work with Six-Thirty. He couldn’t stand the thought of Elizabeth driving back home alone. There were trees out there, and trains. 
1. She would hate it if she knew how much he worried and fussed, so he didn’t tell her. 
1. He remembered he had gotten another letter from someone claiming to be his mother, and his brother, and someone whom he stole all their ideas from. 
1. He never received any from someone pretending to be his father. Maybe because his father was out there pretending he didn’t have a son. 
1. Calvin had only mentioned his grudge toward his father to the bishop and a pen pal. When he told the pen pal he wished his father was dead, he stopped writing back. This was not the reaction Calvin expected. 
1. This is why he did not tell Elizabeth. He worried she would drop him if he did. She might question why he didn’t tell her earlier.
1. He had never been into self-improvement. Maybe that is the definition of love: to want to change for someone else. 
1. As he bent down, his chest filled with something new. He found this woman, this dog, this row, this run: It was all more than he ever deserved. 
1. As he opened the door, Six-Thirty hesitated. It was dark and drizzly. Calvin clipped on the leash for the first time. He was dead thirty-seven minutes later.
## Chapter 11: Budget Cuts 
1. Six-Thirty picked up his place five paces in front of Calvin. He glanced back every so often to make sure Calvin was still there. 
1. They turned into an older neighborhood filled with big houses. “Someday we’ll live here,” Calvin told Six-Thirty. 
1. As they turned again, Calvin almost slipped on some moss before returning to running. 
1. Six-Thirty looked ahead to see a line of police squad cars lined up for inspection. Six-Thirty didn’t like the police parking lot, especially the way they backed out in such a hurry. 
1. Due to budget cuts, the cars were just sitting there, not getting inspected. 
1. CRACK! From the darkness came a loud popping sound. 
1. Six-Thirty tried to bolt but was yanked back by the leash. They both pulled in opposite directions. Going nowhere.
1. Calvin slipped on some motor oil, falling to the pavement. As Six-Thirty turned to help, he lifted his head just in time to see the wheels of a patrol car bump over Calvin’s body. 
1. The patrolman jumped out of the car. “Oh my god, did we hit him?” 
1. Calvin layed there, with his skull fractured. “Six-Thirty?” he whispered. The policeman didn’t understand. 
1. Six-Thirty stood ten feet away. He wanted nothing more than to go to Calvin’s side. But he knew. Calvin’s eyes drifted shut and his chest stopped moving. 
1. He turned and went to give Elizabeth the bad news.
## Chapter 12: Calvin’s Parting Gift 
1. Elizabeth blamed herself. She bought the dog leash. The officers didn’t understand her logic. She hoped this meant she’d dreamt the whole thing. Maybe Calvin was still alive. 
1. For the next few days, Elizabeth lay in bed. Unable to sleep or eat. She kept getting phone calls from the funeral house. This reminded her it was true. Calvin was gone. 
1. The funeral was packed. The Hasting’s employees only looked sad on the outside. Elizabeth and Six-Thirty sat away from others. 
1. A reporter came up to Elizabeth. They asked how she knew Calvin. She denied each of the reporter’s guesses. Then, the reporter asked how long Elizabeth had known Calvin. “Not long enough,” Elizabeth replied. 
1. Elizabeth walked six miles home from the funeral. Denying a ride from anyone who offered. 
1. The next day, Elizabeth couldn’t stand being in the house. She went to work. All of her coworkers seemed to avoid her. The only place Elizabeth felt she could go was Calvin’s lab.
1. Elizabeth was shocked. There was only one box of Calvin’s things left. Inside the box was a lunch box. Elizabeth opened it. She found the wedding ring. 
1. Just then, Miss Frask walked in. She stopped Elizabeth. Luckily, Elizabeth was able to hide the ring in her palm. 
1. Frask hated Elizabeth. “Whether or not Mr. Evans was getting the milk for free doesn’t mean his death hurt you any less.”, said Frask. 
1. After this, Frask told her she couldn’t bring Six-Thirty to work. Then, told Elizabeth she would find love again. 
1. Frask sent Elizabeth home. Elizabeth felt the cruelty of Frask. She turned and threw up in the sink. “In shock,” Frask said. 
1. Frask showed Elizabeth a photo the reporter had published of her. It came with a story about how even his girlfriend said she barely knew him. 
1. Elizabeth threw up again. Frask took a closer look at Elizabeth. Then asked Elizabeth if she had studied biology. Elizabeth was confused. “Zott, we’re women! You know very well Evans left you something!” 
1. Elizabeth’s eyes opened wide. She was sick again.
## Chapter 13: Idiots 
1. Hastings Research Institute had a big problem. Their star scientist was dead and the papers kept saying he had accomplished nothing worthwhile due to his lousy personality. 
1. They were determined to prove he had been making progress with his research. He had to have, right? With all those notebooks and strange equations overflowing in his office. 
1. Most of Hastings’ scientists were average. That was their second problem. Management had to rely on the innovators. With Evans gone, they didn’t have many other options. 
1. Management’s third problem was Zott. She was one of the innovators. Unrecognized of course. But not a week went by where they didn’t get some complaint about her. 
1. Her project on Abiogenesis had only been approved because a fat-cat investor had fallen from the sky and donated money to the project. He wished to meet with Mr.Zott, but Hastings told him Mr.Zott was in Europe.
1. Once he finds out Mr.Zott was a Mrs.Zott, they were sure the investor would drop out. “What a pity,” the man spoke before getting into his limo and driving off. 
1. Her abiogenesis theories – according to Evans – were spot on. Long ago, Darwin proposed life grew from one single-celled bacterium. Zott was determined to figure out where that first cell came from. 
1. And another minor detail that management just learned: Zott was pregnant. As in unwed and pregnant. 
1. Fortunately, Zott did work with three others. Once the PhDs were in the room though, Hastins knew they were in trouble. Two admitted that Zott was in charge, and the third was a scientific idiot. 
1. Then, Miss Frask from personnel spread the word that Zott was pregnant. Hastings knew they’d be in trouble when the Fat-Cat investor found out she was a woman. No one likes a scandal. 
1. “I’m afraid you put us in a terrible position Ms.Zott,” scolded Dr. Donatti. 
1. Elizabeth was confused: You’re firing me?? 
1. Elizabeth continued: What about the man? When a woman gets pregnant outside of marriage, does the man who gets her pregnant also get fired? 
1. “Of course not!” yelled Dr. Donatti. 
1. “You have no grounds to fire me. I have read the employee manual front to back.”
1. The room fell silent. She kept disagreeing as if she knew she’d win in the end. This was exactly the behavior her co workers complained of. 
1. Donatti didn’t budge. “Sign it. Salary ends Friday. Health benefits end Friday. You’re not allowed to speak to anyone about the reasons for your dismissal.” 
1. He continued, “I hope this might teach you to start being accountable for your outrageous behavior. And stop blaming others, like Evans. After he forced us to fund you. After he stood in front of Hastings management and threatened to leave if we didn’t.” 
1. Elizabeth looked as if she’d been slapped: “He did what?”
## Chapter 14: Grief 
1. Six-Thirty would visit Calvin’s grave. He pressed his nose deep into the grass to communicate. Hello Calvin, We need to talk about Elizabeth. 
1. About 3 months ago, Six-Thirty watched Elizabeth take a sledgehammer to the cupboards. Elizabeth was preparing to build a lab in the house. 
1. People underestimate what a pregnant woman is capable of. More often, they underestimate what a hurting pregnant woman is capable of. 
1. Sometimes, the doorbell would ring. The Hasting’s Lab employees would stop by when they had trouble with test results. 
1. Elizabeth decided to begin charging. She made a living doing other people’s work without any credit. It was just like working at Hastings. 
1. Elizabeth’s lab had sinks, burners, hoses, and a fume hood. 
1. Six-Thirty went to visit Calvin again. He began speaking to him. She never sleeps. She always pushes herself. Or she stares off into space. This can’t be good for the creature. Six-Thirty called the baby creature.
1. Six-Thirty looked up to see the cemetery groundskeeper. He was pointing a rifle at him. Six-Thirty jumped and knocked the man to the ground. A bullet went past his ear into Calvin’s tombstone. 
1. Six-Thirty noticed a pool of blood and propped the man’s head up. Then barked until people came. 
1. The next day Six-Thirty was in the newspaper for saving the man’s life. There were promises to get a new groundskeeper.
## Chapter 15: Unsolicited Advice 
1. Everywhere Elizabeth went, someone commented on her belly. In line at the grocery store they reminded her again. “I’ve been meaning to get this checked. What do you think it could be? Not a tumor, I hope.”, Elizabeth responded. 
1. Elizabeth went to the cemetery. She noticed a new tombstone. They replaced the damaged one. 
1. Elizabeth put the chemical equation of happiness on his new tombstone. 
1. Elizabeth went for a checkup. On the elevator, a man put her hand on her stomach. “Remove your hand or live to regret it,” Elizabeth said to him. 
1. Elizabeth began to fill out paperwork. Husband’s telephone number. Husband’s insurance. Husband’s telephone number. Husband’s age and bank account number. “Who’s having the baby here?” Elizabeth asked. 
1. Dr. Mason began the check-in with Elizabeth. He recognized her from rowing and asked why she stopped. Elizabeth explained Calvin’s passing.
1. The appointment continued. Dr. Mason asked Elizabeth why she waited so long to come in. She was over 6 months pregnant. “Work”, she told him, lying. She had hoped the pregnancy would take care of itself. 
1. Dr. Mason showed Elizabeth kindness. Elizabeth finally didn’t feel so alone. She felt tears behind her eyes. “Not every woman wants to be a mother,” Elizabeth shared. 
1. Elizabeth told Dr. Mason that she continues to row. It’s the only thing that tires her out. 
1. Dr. Mason asked if she had anyone to lean on. “A dog”, Elizabeth answered. He told her that he wants to see her at the boathouse to row when she recovers. 
1. “Things will be fine. Maybe even better than fine.”, Dr. Mason said. He then took both her hands and squeezed them.
## Chapter 16: Labor 
1. Elizabeth had been reading aloud to Six-Thirty. Long ago she replaced simple children’s books with more complex texts. 
1. She thought he might like Moby Dick. It was a story about how humans underestimated other life-forms. It cost them their lives. 
1. “Reading aloud promotes brain development and vocabulary growth,” she told him. It seemed to be working because according to her notebook, he knew 391 words. 
1. When Elizabeth called him “smart”, he wanted to agree. But he still wasn’t sure what the “smart” meant. It seemed to have many different definitions, and humans used it when it agreed with their own rules. 
1. For example, they said Dolphins are smart, but cows are not. Six-Thirty assumes this is because cows don’t do tricks. He thought that makes them smarter, not dumber. 
1. Even worse, Elizabeth told him that English wasn’t the only human language. No wonder people don’t understand animals, they barely understand each other.
1. At least she realized he couldn’t draw. This was the way most children chose to communicate. 
1. “What a pretty picture!” a mother exclaimed while looking at her child’s violent scribble. 
1. “It’s a dead puppy!” he told her, which was disturbingly accurate. 
1. “No it is not. It is a very happy puppy eating a bowl of ice cream.” 
1. The frustrated child flung the chalk across the grass and stomped away. Six-Thirty retrieved the chalk, a gift for the creature. 
1. They walked the five blocks together. Elizabeth was in a dress that strained her baby bump. She talked of being so hungry she could eat a horse. 
1. She’d been tracking her glucose levels and the amino acid chain of her hair’s keratin. She also monitored her body’s temperature. 
1. Six-Thirty was glad she was finally taking interest in their creature. 
1. All she had purchased so far were thick white squares with dangerous looking pins. She had also purchased three tiny outfits that looked like sacks. 
1. “We’ve still got two weeks to go,” Elizabeth went on, “the important thing to remember is to stay calm when the time comes.”
1. But Six-Thirty was not calm. He noticed her water had broken several hours ago. And her hunger pains were not hunger pains, they were contractions. 
1. As they stepped into the library, the creature made things more clear: Elizabeth doubled over in pain. 
1. Thirteen hours later, Dr.Mason held up an infant for Elizabeth to see. 
1. “That’s a big one, definitely a rower,” he told her. 
1. Worried about Six-Thirty, Elizabeth checked herself out early. 
1. “Absolutely not! It’s against protocol!” the head nurse told her. 
1. “Tell him I need to erg. He’ll understand.” 
1. When they arrived, Six-Thirty was waiting at the front door. Elizabeth knelt down and showed him the creature. 
1. Hello Creature! It’s me! Six-Thirty! I’ve been worried sick! 
1. “Oh my, it’s nine-twenty-two. You haven’t eaten in over 24 hours!” said Elizabeth as she consulted her watch. 
1. Six-Thirty was named after the time he’s become a part of the family. Now he knew just what the creature would be called: Hello Nine Twenty-Two! Please come in, I’ve got chalk! 
1. For the first time since Calvin’s death, a strange joy filled the air…until 10 minutes later when the creature started to cry and everything fell apart.
## Chapter 17: Harriet Sloane 
1. “What’s wrong?!” Elizabeth begged the baby to tell her for the millionth time. But the baby refused to be specific. 
1. Even Six-Thirty was confused: But I told you about your father. 
1. Elizabeth almost tripped as she paced around with the baby at 2AM. The floor had become a convenient dumping ground for everything. 
1. She nudged the bottle toward her daughter for the 5th time. This time she latched on intensely. Elizabeth held her breath. The baby was a ticking time bomb. 
1. Dr.Mason had warned her that infants were hard work. But this was more than work. There was repetitiveness. This could go on for years. 
1. Plus, she still had all her other work to do. She looked across the room at her research notebooks. When she had refused anesthesia, it was because she couldn’t afford it. 
1. From below came a small sigh. Elizabeth was surprised to find her daughter asleep. She stayed still for two hours.
1. Then, she swiftly moved to the bedroom. She slept heavily until the baby awoke. Which was approximately 5 minutes later. 
1. Dr. Boryweitz came to visit at 7AM. He said, “I heard you had the baby. Congratulations,” and he held out a wrapped gift. 
1. She opened it to find a plastic pacifier and a small stuffed rabbit. She thanked him. He was the first adult she’d talked to in weeks. 
1. He held out some bills from his wallet, “I’ve got a meeting with Donatti in two hours. Please.” 
1. She hesitated, but she hadn’t had any income for months. She talked with him for a full hour about her research. 
1. She had fallen asleep. Calvin was in her dream. He was reading a book. 
1. There came a tap tap tap tap tap. She heard someone calling her name. Then more tapping. 
1. There was a strange wail that made Calvin jump up and run out of the room. 
1. Elizabeth woke up to find a gray-haired woman walking around her lab. 
1. It was Mrs.Sloane. She saw Elizabeth slumped on the floor and got worried. 
1. She left and got the crying baby. Elizabeth told her that her daughter’s name was Madeline.
1. “Ever since you brought your little Satan home, I told myself to stop by. I also wanted to say sorry about Mr.Evans. I know it’s late to say…” Mrs. Sloane told her. 
1. Elizabeth questioned how she knew Calvin. 
1. Mrs. Sloane is her neighbor across the street. She lived next to Calvin for many years. 
1. Mrs.Sloane stuck around for coffee. She watched as Elizabeth made the coffee using beakers and a bunsen burner. It was the best coffee she’d ever had. 
1. “I thought you had some help. I would have come earlier. You’ve had so many men coming by at the oddest hours,” said Mrs. Sloane. 
1. Elizabeth assured her they were visiting for work. She told her she was a scientist. 
1. Mrs.Sloane offered her help, and left Elizabeth her number. 
1. Just as she was leaving, Elizabeth confessed, “I’m a terrible mother. I’ve fallen asleep on the job. She won’t follow a schedule. I’m not having any blissful moments with her. I have even wanted to give her away twice.” 
1. Mrs.Sloane laughed. She knew the hardship of motherhood. She told Elziabeth not to worry. 
1. Mrs.Sloane left Elizabeth with one piece of advice: Take one moment for yourself every single day. Then go back.
## Chapter 18: Legally Mad
1. Mrs. Sloane thought Calvin dated Elizabeth because she’s pretty. She also thought pretty people were trouble. 
1. Later, Mrs. Sloane realized they were a very happy couple. This was unlike her own marriage. She couldn’t remember when she fell out of love. Maybe when he had magazines of other women on their honeymoon. 
1. After Mr. Evans died, Mrs. Sloane noticed men stopping by. Worried she may have picked up Mr. Sloane’s judgmental ways, she decided to check on Elizabeth. 
1. Mrs. Sloane peeked through the curtain. Call me. Call me. She thought to herself. 
1. Elizabeth picked up the phone to call Mrs. Sloane a dozen times in the last four days. She didn’t feel capable of raising a human.
1. Elizabeth had another problem. Every time she looked into Madeline’s eyes, Calvin looked back. She was still mad at him. For lying about her research funding and running outdoors. Everyone else ran indoors. 
1. This is how grief works. She kept it to herself. Except during labor. She remembered shouting and digging her nails into someone’s arm. There was someone else near her shrieking and swearing. 
1. The nurse came back and asked Elizabeth how she felt. “Mad” Elizabeth told her. “Mad?”, the nurse asked. The nurse wrote “Mad” on the birth certificate and then walked out of the room. 
1. Elizabeth and Six-Thirty were trying to think of a name for the baby. Six-Thirty remembered the name of a character from a book they read. “What about Madeline?” Elizabeth asked after finding the book open on her nightstand. 
1. The name change required going to City Hall. There, she was asked for a marriage certificate and other information she did not want to share. 
1. Elizabeth met Six-Thirty back on the stairs outside City Hall. “She’s legally Mad, but we will call her Madeline. No one will know,” Elizabeth said. Legally Mad, Six-Thirty thought. What could possibly go wrong? 
1. Elizabeth wasn’t religious, but there was something holy about Mrs. Sloane. She had actual wisdom. About how to survive. How to get on with what is at hand. 
1. Elizabeth called Mrs. Sloane. “Mrs. Sloane, this is Elizabeth Zott.” “Be right over”, Mrs. Sloane responded.
## Chapter 19: December 1956
1. As soon as Mad could walk, Elizabeth encouraged her to touch, taste, and play with anything she found. 
1. Six-Thirty was always there, protecting her from danger. He failed to protect Calvin. He would not fail again. 
1. Harriet scolded Elizabeth. She told her she must watch Mad. She can’t just do whatever she wants. 
1. Harriet liked Six-Thirty. She felt like she and the dog shared similar worries. They worried about Elizabeth’s parenting. 
1. By the way, Six-Thirty’s word count was up to 497.
1. Dr. Mason didn’t underestimate Six-Thirty either. He also understood what it meant to be a working mother. 
1. Dr. Mason stopped by a year after the birth to see how things were going and to remind Elizabeth about his boat.
1. Dr. Mason showed up at the door at 7:15 AM in his rowing kit. He never checks up on patients after a delivery. 
1. He thought it was time for Elizabeth to come back to rowing. They have an open seat. 
1. Elizabeth argued. Dr. Mason began cleaning dishes. 
1. Dr. Mason said, “Being an adult is overrated. But a chilly splash of water in the face before dawn? It fixes things. 
1. Elizabeth sipped on coffee as Dr. Mason kept talking. She had reached a new stage in her grief: She went from mourning her husband to mourning the father he would have been. 
1. Elizabeth and Calvin never wanted children. But here she was. Parenting felt like she was taking a test she did not study for. 
1. Dr. Mason said you’d be surprised how much you can tell about a baby at this age. 
1. Elizabeth agreed. Last week, she saw Mad explaining something to Six-Thirty. She babbled like she was an expert in the area. 
1. Dr. Mason explained that the last rower, who was in the two-seat position, was terrible. He also broke his leg in a ski accident. 
1. He told Elizabeth, “I don’t mean to put you on the spot, but we need you. Ask your neighbor if she can watch the baby.”
1. Harriet agreed to watch the baby while Elizabeth rowed. Her husband had been drinking more, and she liked to stay away. 
1. The best part of rowing was that it happened at 4:30 AM, a time when no one was busy. 
1. Elizabeth walked through the boathouse. Many rowers looked at her, surprised. 
1. Dr. Mason told them all she would be rowing with them. They stood in silence. 
1. Dr. Mason thought the row went well. Elizabeth wasn’t so sure, but the truth was, she loved being back on the water.
## Chapter 20: Life Story
1. Mad was 3 years old. She read better than most 6th graders. Just like her parents, she didn’t have many friends. 
1. Elizabeth told Mrs. Sloane that she was worried this was a gene. “The I-hate-people gene?” Mrs. Sloane asked. “Introversion.”, Elizabeth corrected. 
1. “I signed Mad up for kindergarten. The new school year starts on Monday. Mad needs to be around children,” Elizabeth told Mrs. Sloane. 
1. Mrs. Sloane was concerned that Madeline was growing in ways other children were not. The other day, she asked Madeline if she wanted to make mud pies. Mad frowned. Then, she wrote 3.1415. 
1. Madeline was too young for school. Elizabeth learned the chemical makeup of ink and changed her birth certificate. 
1. Mrs. Sloane worried. If Madeline went to school, what would Elizabeth do with her day? Six-Thirty did not like the news either. How could he protect her if she was in a classroom?
1. The truth was Elizabeth needed money. She took out a reverse mortgage on the house. 
1. A banker told her, “As soon as your child is old enough, get her in school. Then find a job that pays.” 
1. One day, Madeline gave her mother a drawing. She pointed out the pit of death and tears on the paper. 
1. Elizabeth and Six-Thirty. Elizabeth asked, “Are you sad, honey?” 
1. Mad placed her hands on her mother’s face. “No. But you are.”, Mad said. 
1. Elizabeth went back to Hastings and asked for her job back. Mr. Donatti was very happy to see her. 
1. Donatti offered her a job. The investor of the abiogenesis project was calling for updates. 
1. Mrs. Sloane was against Elizabeth working at Hastings because of how they treated her before. “Second time’s the charm,” Elizabeth said.
## Chapter 21: E.Z. 
1. Hastings welcomed Elizabeth back with a new lab coat. “E.Z.” was stitched above the pocket. Donatti announced he has an article coming out in the Science Journal. 
1. Donatti asked Elizabeth when her paper would be out. He had already gone through her files and knew it was close. 
1. Elizabeth was demoted to a lab tech. Donatti told her they were out of coffee and gave her a stack of papers to type. 
1. Elizabeth disagreed with the change. “Relax, Luscious,” he told her. “What did you just call me?!” Elizabeth asked. 
1. Donatti told her they would pay for her to go to typing school. He said she could do it in her free time. 
1. Elizabeth went to the restroom. She heard banging from the stall next to her. “Is everything okay?” she asked. “Mind your business,” a voice shot back.
1. Elizabeth knew the voice. It was Miss Frask. The one who had tortured her about Calvin’s passing years earlier. 
1. Miss Frask asked if she brought the dog. “He’s busy in the afternoons,” Elizabeth responded. 
1. Frask continued, “Out of all the employees, you are the only female who is not a secretary. I can’t imagine how that could have happened. Do you know why they say women aren’t a good investment? It’s because they run off and get pregnant like you did.” 
1. “I was fired. Thanks, in part, to women like you,” Elizabeth responded. 
1. Elizabeth began pounding on the wall separating them. “How dare you!” she yelled. “I’m a chemist. Not a woman chemist. A chemist. A damn good one!” They came out of the stalls. 
1. Miss Frask shouted that she was almost a psychologist. “Almost?” Zott asked. 
1. Miss Frask asked. “Why don’t you have your Ph.D.?” Elizabeth said, “My thesis advisor sexually violated me, then kicked me out of the doctoral program.” 
1. Frask looked shocked. “Same,” she said softly. Elizabeth did not mean to share that.
## Chapter 22: The Present 
1. Elizabeth asked Madeline what she learned on her first day of school. “Nothing. And some of the kids are incontinent.” 
1. Madeline said, “Also, Mrs. Mudforf wants to see you.” She held out a note. 
1. Elizabeth went to Personnel at Hastings for information on her research investor. Ms. Frask looked in the files. There was nothing. 
1. Ms. Frask also shared that she was going to be fired. “Remember my improvement plan to lose twenty pounds? I gained 7.” 
1. “You can’t be fired for gaining weight. That’s illegal.” Elizabeth begged Ms. Frask to fight this. Ms. Frask told Elizabeth that she has a temporary typing job in place.
1. “Before I leave, I have a little present for you. Something to make up for all the grief I caused after Mr. Evans died. Meet me on Friday at 4 o’clock. 
1. Friday came, and Ms. Frask led Elizabeth to a room she had never seen. It was a room of Calvin’s work. “We need to hurry. I have to turn in these keys by 5 o’clock,” said Ms. Frask. 
1. “Is this legal?” Elizabeth asked. Ms. Frask reached for a box. “Do we care?” she responded.
## Chapter 23: KCTV Studios 
One Month Later 
1. Walter Pine was an afternoon TV producer. 
1. Walter worked to support his daughter. He would do anything for his daughter Amanda. 
1. Elizabeth talked to Walter a few days ago about Amanda. She was eating Madeline’s lunch at school. Walter was not surprised. Amanda was always causing trouble. 
1. Walter could not stop thinking about Elizabeth.
1. Elizabeth worked at Hastings for two months now. Donatti’s paper was published in the journal Science. Donatti described it as “Nothing earth-shattering.” 
1. Donatti’s article was actually Elizabeth’s work. Her blood pressure rose as she read the journal.
1. Her coworker told her Donatti photocopied her files the first day she returned to work. 
1. Elizabeth went to Donatti’s office. “You’re a liar and a cheat. You won’t get away with this!” Elizabeth said. 
1. Donatti enjoyed taking in her fury. Calvin would have quit over this, he thought. 
1. Elizabeth did what neither of them could afford. She quit.
1. Elizabeth arrived home to Mad and Mrs. Sloane. Walter tried calling 4 times. Mrs. Sloane put a casserole in the oven and headed home. 
1. Ever since Elizabeth returned to Hastings, this was their schedule. Mrs. Sloane would take Mad to school. Six-Thirty would pick her up. 
1. Madeline handed Elizabeth a note. “From you know who. Mrs. Mudford,” Mad said. Elizabeth knew her teacher didn’t like her. 
1. Mrs. Mudford met with Elizabeth. She told her that Madeline couldn’t talk about civil rights with other kindergarteners. 
1. Amanda was in trouble a lot. So, Mr. Pine was also familiar with Mrs. Mudford.
1. Mrs. Mudford was often upset with what was in Amanda’s lunch. Once, he packed a flask where her milk thermos should go. He’s depressed and tired. 
1. Madeline told Elizabeth she didn’t like school. “Are we poor?” she asked. A boy from school had said they were poor. 
1. The answer to Mad’s question was in one of Calvin’s boxes Elizabeth took from Hastings. Calvin had many job offers. Hastings was the lowest offer. He chose Hastings for rowing. 
1. Also in Calvin’s boxes were letters from his pen pal, Wakely. In one of the letters, Wakely asked if his father was a scientist. 
1. “I HATE MY FATHER. I HOPE HE’S DEAD.” Calvin wrote back. Elizabeth was confused. She thought his father was dead. 
1. The phone rang. It was Mr. Pine. He told her about his job and trends in cooking shows. “I want to create a cooking show for afternoon TV. I want you to be the host.” “I’m a scientist!” Elizabeth snapped.
1. Elizabeth asked how much it would pay. She agreed to the job. Elizabeth hated the idea of making food on TV for housewives.
## Chapter 24: The Afternoon Depression Zone 
1. Elizabeth refused to wear the skin-tight clothing KCTV brought to her wardrobe. 
1. Walter clenched his teeth. Was this going to work? 
1. Elizabeth solved the wardrobe problem. She wanted to wear a lab coat. She also wanted a Bunsen burner and stainless steel countertops. 
1. He would tell the tailor to loosen the seams on her clothing. In return, she needed to smile more. 
1. Walter told her he would consider the lab coat idea. For now, he wanted her to be her, not a scientist. 
1. Walter reminded Elizabeth that her audience was the average housewife. She needed to simplify her subjects. 
1. Walter needed the kitchen to look like most housewives’ kitchens. He also explained the 3 rules of TV: Entertain. Entertain. Entertain. 
1. Phil Lebensmal, the executive producer of KCTV, was very clear about the cooking show. Every man wants to see a sexy wife-mother. 
1. Walter tried to convince Phil. “Did I tell you that Mrs. Zott can actually cook? She’s a chemist.” 
1. Elizabeth’s show was during the Afternoon Depression Zone. This is when you want to rest in the middle of the day. 
1. Housewives can’t rest at this time. They have to worry about taking care of their children. So, they turn on the TV. 
1. Afternoon TV is designed to let the brain rest. 
1. Walter told Elizabeth: You have to make it fun. I believe in you. I believe in your mission that food matters. 
1. Elizabeth hadn’t thought about TV in this way. It was TV science. 
1. When Walter brought up Mr. Zott, she explained they were never married. She was asked not to tell Phil Lebensmal about this. 
1. She explained how she killed Calvin. She insisted he used a leash, and he died. 
1. Walter understood. Both of their bad choices resulted in their children dealing with the consequences. 
1. She apologized for his divorce. He blurted out that Amanda was not technically his child by DNA.
## Chapter 25: The Average Jane 
1. Looking back, he should have let her see the set. Elizabeth walked out on stage. She wore a tight dress, an apron, and a fancy watch. She also had a pencil in her hair and test tubes in her hand. 
1. Elizabeth looked at the decorations. Bless This House, written on the wall. Our daily bread, on the bread box. She hated it. 
1. Walter gave the set designer an A+ for his work. He said it is what women wanted. 
1. “I’m a woman, and I don’t want this,” Elizabeth said. “I didn’t mean you. I meant the average Jane,” he responded. 
1. She read the script on the screen and then turned away. She didn’t like the script. “This is revolting,” she said to the camera. 
1. Elizabeth requested to go to commercial. “This doesn't work for me,” she told Walter. Walter assured her everything in the kitchen worked, and he agreed she could make changes later.
1. Walter begged her to follow the script. The cameras were on. She began to read the script. “Today we’re going to have so much --.” She stopped when she got to the word “fun.” 
1. “I take cooking seriously. And I know you do, too,” Elizabeth said. “I also know that many people do not appreciate the work that goes into being a mother,” she continued. 
1. Walter’s boss screamed at him for 20 minutes. Then Walter went to find Elizabeth. “This is a job. You have two duties: smile and read cue cards. You don’t get to have an opinion.” 
1. Elizabeth told Walter the script was terrible and then asked who wrote it. “I did,” Walter said. Those words didn’t sound like me,” she said. “That was intentional,” he responded. 
1. “You have to be positive, happy, upbeat.”, Walter told Elizabeth. Elizabeth reflected on her life. “Not a chance”, she said. 
1. A secretary came into the room. “Mr. Lebensmal said you have a week to fix ‘it.’ And to make it ‘sexy,’.” she said. 
1. Elizabeth wrote a shopping list for the next day’s recipe. Someone called and asked what an ingredient was. Elizabeth wrote it in chemical form. They had never gotten a call about the afternoon TV show they had before.
## Chapter 26: The Funeral 
1. There was now a live audience at the show. 
1. Walter was mad at Elizabeth. She wouldn’t follow the script he wrote. He thought she was boring. 
1. Elizabeth didn’t like the kitchen. She told the audience she needed room to work, and then she started giving away the decorations. 
1. Elizabeth always talked about chemistry and ignored the script. 
1. Later, Elizabeth talked to Walter during a commercial. He was mad. 
1. The show started again. “Cooking is chemistry. And chemistry is life. Your ability to change starts here,” she told the audience. 
1. Walter watched nervously. The secretary gave him a message. His boss wanted to see him on Monday morning. 
1. Elizabeth spoke, “Being brave in the kitchen makes you brave in life.” 
1. Walter thought to himself, “bored to death” might not just be a saying. 
1. When the show ended, Walter almost fainted. He hadn’t eaten all day. 
1. Elizabeth offered him the spinach casserole she just made. He told her he didn’t want it. “Amanda hates Casserole,” Walter said. 
1. In the parking lot, he found the casserole on his car hood. He was too tired to cook when he got home. Amanda said it was the best thing she’d ever eaten.
## Chapter 27: All About Me 
May 1960 
1. Mrs. Mudford gave the students a project called “All About Me.” She sent home a family tree for the mothers to fill in. 
1. A student asked if animals could go on the tree. Mrs. Mudford said, “Animals are not people.” Madeline argued with her, and she kept Madeline after class. 
1. Mrs. Sloane tried to tell Mad why she couldn’t argue with adults. “Even if she tells us the wrong stuff?” Mad asked. “Last week, she said God made the earth,” Mad said. 
1. Mrs. Sloane looked at the family tree project. She told Mad not to show her mom. She would be mad. Mad thought about how she didn't know anything about her dad. 
1. This reminded Mad of a note in her lunch this morning. Her mom wrote, “The librarian is the most important educator in the school. What she doesn’t know, she can find out. Don't share this with Mrs. Mudford.” 
1. Earlier that day, Mad went to the library to look for Cambridge yearbooks. She didn’t find any. 
1. Mrs. Sloane talked to Mad about her father. She mentioned he had a godmother. She told Madeline a godmother looks after you in your spiritual life. 
1. Mrs. Sloane told Mad she doesn’t believe in anything she can’t see. Mad questioned why she believed in God. 
1. Mrs. Sloane thought it was wrong not to believe in God. In her opinion, believing in God was required. Even bad people like her husband believed in God. 
1. Mad sat and read the book, Five Years with the Congo Cannibals. Mrs. Sloane said not to tell Mrs. Mudford about the book. 
1. Mrs. Sloane wondered if Mad was a genius. Mad’s father was. 
1. Maybe Mad was smart because she was well-taught. Elizabeth refused to accept limits, not just for herself, but for others.
1. Once Mrs. Sloane found a list of words that Elizabeth was teaching Six-Thirty. She didn’t believe it. Until one day, Mad asked where her yo-yo was. Six-Thirty dropped it in her lap. 
1. Mad and Mrs. Sloane watched Supper at Six together every day. Mad shared that some kids have the same lunch as her at school now. 
1. They held their breath during each show. They thought each episode would be the last. 
1. Mrs. Sloane suggested Elizabeth smile during the show. “Do surgeons smile? No. Would you want them to? No. It requires focus. So does cooking.”, Elizabeth said. 
1. Elizabeth was called to Mrs. Mudford’s classroom. She said Madeline did not want to play with the girl toys. 
1. Madeline also wanted to be on the safety patrol, but she was not allowed to do so. 
1. It was also a problem that Mad was the tallest in her class. It made the boys sad. 
1. Mrs. Mudford said, “Boys will be boys.”
## Chapter 28: Saints 
1. Mad went to the city library to ask for an address in Iowa. She was looking for a boy’s home that had a girl’s name. 
1. The librarian told her she needed more information. “I put my name on Sioux City,” came a voice from behind. It was the Reverend. He said a child could mix up “Sioux” with “Sue.” 
1. Mad couldn’t find the Boy's Home in “B.” The Reverend told her many places like that are named after saints. He told her to try Saint Vincent. 
1. “Why are you searching for a boy's home?” asked the Reverend. 
1. Mad told him she was making a family tree. She didn’t have any information about her dad’s side yet. 
1. The Reverend asked why Mad doesn’t just ask her dad. She explained it was because he was dead, too. 
1. Madeline missed him even though she never met him.
1. Madeline told the Reverend that her dad’s home had a “fairy godmother.” The Reverend said that it meant they had a donor. 
1. Mad told him she did not want gaps in the family tree. The reverend explained that people keep secrets about things they are ashamed of. Everyone keeps secrets. 
1. The Reverend told Mad he thinks that family trees are silly. Your family doesn’t make you you. It matters more how you live your life. 
1. They introduced themselves. His name was Reverend Wakely. 
1. Then, he suggested trying “All Saints” because “that’s what they call places when they can’t decide on a single saint.” 
1. Mad found it, but only a phone number was listed. She wasn’t allowed to call long distance. The reverend offered to call for her. 
1. Mad accepted and gave him her dad’s name: Calvin Evans. This name surprised Reverend Wakely. 
1. Reverend Wakely remembered when he attended Harvard Divinity School and took a chemistry course. He wanted to learn how the scientists explained creation so he could disprove it.
