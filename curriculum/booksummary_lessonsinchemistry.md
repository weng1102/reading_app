# Lessons in Chemistry By Bonnie Garmus 
## Chapter 1: November 1961 
1. In 1961, women wore long-sleeved dresses, joined garden clubs, and raised kids. Nobody knew there would be a ‘60s movement. 
1. After the big wars, people felt fresh and believed everything was possible. That was not the case for Elizabeth Zott, a 30-year-old mother. 
1. Elizabeth woke up every morning and was sure of one thing: her life was over. 
1. Elizabeth went to the kitchen to make her daughter Madeline lunch. On a note, she wrote, “Fuel for learning.” She paused, “Play sports at recess, but do not automatically let the boys win.” She paused again and wrote, “It is not your imagination. Most people are awful.” 
1. Madeline was a gifted child. She learned to read at three. She could hum a Bach concerto. She was that kind of child. She could explain the earth’s movement but not tie her shoes. 
1. This was Madeline’s problem. Children gifted in music are often celebrated, but early readers are not. Everyone learns to read. So being first isn’t special - it’s just annoying. 
1. Madeline knew this. Every morning, she took the notes from her lunch and put them in a shoebox in her closet. At school, she pretended she didn’t know how to read. 
1. To Madeline, fitting in with other kids was so important. Her mother never fit in. Look what happened to her.
1. Elizabeth and Madeline live in the Southern California town of Commons. 
1. Madeline lay in bed, waiting for her mom's gentle kiss on her forehead. 
1. Then, Madeline heard her mom’s car drive away to the television studio.
1. At the studio, Elizabeth would put on an apron and walk out onto the set. The show was called Supper at Six, and Elizabeth Zott was a star. 
## Chapter 2: Pine 
1. Elizabeth was a research chemist until she became a TV star. Food theft led to her discovery as a TV star. 
1. Most of Madeline’s classmates ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch. Elizabeth packed Madeline a tasty lunch of lasagna, zucchini, chopped kiwi, cherry tomatoes, and a salt shaker. Everyone wanted Madeline’s lunch. 
1. Madeline gave her lunch away every day to a girl named Amanda Pine. Madeline chose Amanda because she was the only one in the school who didn’t make fun of her. 
1. Elizabeth noticed Madeline losing weight. As a scientist, Elizabeth wanted an explanation. She calculated what her daughter needed to be healthy. Weight loss was not possible. 
1. Elizabeth met Amanda Pine and saw the tomato sauce on her lips. Elizabeth then figured out who ate Madeline’s food.
1. Elizabeth called for Mr. Pine as she walked into the local TV studio. “I’ve been calling you for three days,” she said. She then continued explaining his daughter was eating Madeleine's food. 
1. Walter Pine was confused. He stood and took in the glowing woman wearing a white lab coat in front of him. Elizabeth was tall and stiff with beautiful blonde hair tied up using a pencil. She stood with her hands on her hips. 
1. As a long-time TV producer, Walter knew drama. But this? She was stunning. He was literally stunned by her. Was she auditioning for something? 
1. Elizabeth explained why she was there. Walter finally understood who she was. Walter said that he and Mrs. Pine are divorced. 
1. Elizabeth explained that she had no time to make Walter’s daughter’s lunch.
1. Then Elizabeth said, “Does anyone have the time to teach the entire country to make food that matters? I wish I did, but I don’t. Do you?” 
1. Elizabeth wasn’t sure about the idea. She was a research chemist. She took the job because it paid more, and she had a child to support. 
1. Supper at Six aired on TV four weeks later.
1. From the first day on set, Elizabeth had the “it” factor. 
1. People didn’t know what to make of her. Elizabeth Zott was serious. She never made jokes. Her dishes were as honest and down-to-earth as she was. 
1. By 6 months, Elizabeth was a rising star. Her recipes were nutritious and hearty. She made stews and casseroles all in under an hour. 
1. People would say that when Elizabeth Zott finished cooking, an entire nation sat down to eat.
1. She ended every show with the line: “Children, set the table. Your mother needs a moment to herself.” 
1. A reporter called Elizabeth “Luscious Lizzie.” The nickname quickly stuck. 
1. Strangers called Elizabeth “Luscious.” Madeline knew this nickname belittled her mother. 
1. Elizabeth would lay in bed at night and wonder how her life came to this. She already knew. His name was Calvin Evans.  
## Chapter 3: Hastings Research Institute 
1. Calvin Evans worked at Hastings. He had a large lab all to himself. 
1. Elizabeth accepted work at Hastings because it was the only offer she received. 
1. Calvin was brilliant but had a habit of holding grudges and being impatient. 
1. Calvin also had a passion for rowing. 
1. Calvin wasn’t the best at dating, either. He was like a dog who finally catches a squirrel but doesn’t know what to do with it. Part of his problem was his looks. He looked lonely. 
1. When he fell in love with Elizabeth Zott, he began to smile all the time. 
1. Elizabeth went down to Cavin’s lab to ask for beakers. He told her to send her boss. He wanted to talk to a chemist, not a “secretary.” 
1. Elizabeth did not have time to deal with him. “What a coincidence! I’m busy, too!” She took his beakers.
1. A week later, Calvin tracked down Elizabeth. She seemed not to remember him. She said, “Do you mind? Now I’m in the middle of something important.” 
1. Calvin came to apologize. When he asked her out, she declined. She said, “You should know you’re starting to annoy me.” Calvin left. 
1. A lab tech asked if that was Calvin Evans. He said Elizabeth should not have taken his beakers. Calvin is famous for holding a grudge. 
1. Elizabeth holds grudges, too. She holds grudges about men who belittle women. 
1. The next day, the beakers were gone. She heard coworkers talking about her. “She’s not even that smart. Someone should put her in her place.” 
1. Two years ago, Elizabeth was a Master’s student at UCLA. She was close to graduation. 
1. She was in the lab late one night. She heard the door open. She wasn’t expecting anyone. 
1. Her mentor, Dr. Meyers, opened the door. He was one of the top DNA researchers in the United States, but no one liked him. 
1. Every day, Elizabeth dealt with inappropriate comments from him. She needed her degree. 
1. Myers called Elizabeth into his office. Elizabeth was in the lab, double-checking her supervisor’s work. She questioned the research protocol.
1. Myers shoved his hand up her skirt. She said she was going to report him. He turned to the door and locked it. 
1. Myers slapped her. She gasped. He hit her again. 
1. Myers grabbed her hips. Elizabeth fought back. She stabbed him in the stomach with a #2 pencil. 
1. Elizabeth reported the attack to the campus police. They didn’t believe her. 
1. Dr. Meyers said the attack was Elizabeth’s fault. The Admissions Office did not believe him, but he was important. UCLA needed him. 
1. This was the end of Elizabeth’s academic career.
1. At Hastings, Elizabeth was moved to a low-level project for no good reason. 
1. Elizabeth bought herself a ticket to a funny operetta. Coincidentally, Calvin Evans was there too. He left his date and ran into Elizabeth in the lobby. He vomited all over her dress. 
1. She helped him home. He apologized multiple times. “No need to apologize. We’re scientists. We understand these things.” 
1. He clarified. He apologized for assuming she was a secretary the other day. 
1. Next week, they talked chemistry over coffee. 
1. Elizabeth explained her boss, Donatti, took her off the team because of sexual discrimination.
1. More women wanted to be in science, but they were denied education. 
1. Evans offered to use her research and get her back on the team. She reluctantly accepted. 
1. This is work. That’s it. They agreed, but secretly hoped they both did not mean it. 
## Chapter 4: Introduction to Chemistry 
1. As Calvin and Elizabeth left the parking lot after a date, they argued about covalent bonds. 
1. Every date was the high and low of Calvin’s day. He loved seeing her but hated when she left. 
1. Elizabeth explained there had been recent silkworm findings. He pretended to listen. Why was she talking about worms? 
1. What a huge disappointment. She thought she found someone she could talk with. He seemed to have no interest in her. 
1. Calvin wasn’t listening because he was distracted by his own thoughts. The smell of her hair was intoxicating. 
1. Elizabeth felt rejected and depressed. She was falling in love with him. 
1. As she left, Calvin motioned her to roll down her window. 
1. They looked at each other face to face. This time, she did it. They kissed. 
1. It was a permanent bond even chemistry could not explain.
## Chapter 5: Family Values 
1. People at Hastings thought Elizabeth was dating Calvin for fame. Elizabeth and Calvin seemed to fit perfectly. 
1. They lay together at night and talked for hours. One night, Calvin asked Elizabeth about her Thanksgiving plans. 
1. Elizabeth said, “I’m not going home. I thought we might have Thanksgiving here. Together. Unless. Were you planning on going home?” “Absolutely not,” he said. 
1. Over the last few months, they had talked about everything except family. Now, they had a chance to share. Calvin grew up in Iowa, and Elizabeth grew up in Oregon. 
1. Calvin continued to share about his childhood. He told her about his parents, who died in a car accident when he was five. They were hit by a train. 
1. Calvin then went to live with his aunt. She died in a car accident when he was six. 
1. Elizabeth squeezed her eyes shut when he told her, “And then you were put in a….” “A Catholic boys' home,” Calvin finished her sentence. His tone became dark.
1. “You were saying, Oregon?” Calvin continued. “Yes,” Elizabeth described her father as a God salesman. “Someone who preaches gloom and doom to make money.” 
1. “My father is the one who introduced me to chemistry,” Elizabeth said, “He would create a fire using pistachios when he needed a convenient sign from God.” 
1. Calvin tried to hide he was sad not to meet her family. He hoped to sit around a table with a family at Thanksgiving. 
1. “Where’s your brother?” Calvin asked. Elizabeth said, “He hanged himself. John was gay. My father told him God hated him.” Elizabeth was 10 years old, and John was 17 at the time. 
1. Calvin did not understand. He knew people counted on family to get through hard times. He did not realize that family could be the hard time. 
1. Elizabeth said, “While we may be born into families, it doesn’t mean we belong to them. People like my father speak of love but are filled with hate.” 
1. They lay silently, both feeling the hurt of their pasts. “Where are your parents now?” Calvin asked. “My father is in prison. One of his signs from God ended up killing 3 people. My mother divorced, remarried, and moved to Brazil. Did I mention my parents never paid taxes?” 
1. “So after your brother…died…it was just you and your parents?” Calvin asked. “No, just me. My parents were gone for weeks at a time. I taught myself to cook and do small house repairs.”
1. Elizabeth had not gone to school. Instead, she spent her time in the library like she always used to do with her brother. 
1. “When I was a kid, I used to tell myself every day was new. Anything could happen.”, Calvin said. 
1. Elizabeth thought he must have been brave as an orphaned boy. He endured the worst and still decided the next day might be better. 
1. The family memories were too much for him, and he stopped talking. “Let’s call it a day,” Calvin said. Off to bed, they went.
