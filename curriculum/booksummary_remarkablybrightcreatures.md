# Chapters 1-4
## Summary
At the beginning of the book we learn about Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus who was captured and brought to the aquarium in his view as a “prisoner”. A remarkably intelligent creature, who is counting down the days until his death. 160 days remain until his sentence is over.
We learn about Tova Sullivan, a 70 year old woman who works the night shift at the aquarium as a janitor. She prides herself in tidying it up while the messy visitors are away. During her shift one evening she noticed take out food containers scattered on the floor. As Tova bent down she noticed a brownish-orange clump and as she reached for it she realizes it’s a tentacle.
Marcellus is tangled in a mess of cords and shows it is displeased by slapping the ground as Tova gets near. She reassures Marcellus she won’t hurt it and was greeted by the long tentacle wrapping itself around her arm. His eye glints playfully, like a naughty childs. Once he is freed from the cords he releases himself and jets off to the hallway. Tova tries to follow but quickly loses sight of him. She questions her sanity, but notices the round circles where each sucker clung to her skin.
Later Tova meets with her women's group “Knit-Wits”. We learn her son Erik disappeared when he was 18 while working at the ferry ticket booth. One week later they found a boat that was missing from the marina washed ashore with the anchor rope cut off clean. Erik’s prints were recovered from the boat. Evidence pointed to suicide, but Tova never believed it. 
As Tova arrives home from her meeting with the “Knit-Wits”, she listens to the messages on her answering machine. One was from the Charter Village Long-Term Care center with bad news about her brother Lars.

He describes the hole in the glass, from where the pump is located creates a gap to where he is able to fit the tip of a tentacle through. He then unscrews the housing and makes his way down the glass and into the pump room.

Cameron finally opens the “box of baby vipers” and finds it filled with things like half-used lipstick, old higworthless keepsakes. Until a black drawstring bag falls out and he locates a few pieces of jewelry. Most notably a chunky class ring and an old photo of his mom with her arm around a man he’s never seen before. 
Tova finds herself with her brother Lars belongings. She stashes his family photos in the attic where she keeps her own. But one caught her eye. A photo of Lars and Erik on a sailboat.

# Chapter 25-28 
## Summary
It has been confirmed, Tova’s fall resulted in a sprained ankle. Her doctor ordered her to stay off of it for 6 weeks. As she was about to drink her coffee there was a knock on her door. It was Janice with a Potato-leek casserole. She was coming to tell Tova that their friend Mary Ann would be moving away to live with her daughter due to the unsafe conditions of her home. Janice also brought Tova a gift- a cell phone. Something Tova never wanted before, but her friends insisted due to her fall and living alone. 
After Janice left, Tova had another accident when the cell phone started buzzing in her pocket as she was getting the casserole out of the oven. She slipped and fell yet again. Tova started to question who would take care of filling out the doctors forms and making the arrangements like she did for her late husband. She even considered filling out the application at Charter Village, the assisted living facility her brother Lars lived in.
We learn that Cameron purchased the run down camper for $1,200. He finds himself driving overnight to Sowell Bay, the same city Tova lives in. Arriving early in the morning, Cameron stumbles upon Shop-Way, owned by Tova’s friend Ethan (Red Beard). Ethan offers Cameron a meal and a cup of coffee for free. He chats with Elliot and mentions he is looking for his father, Simon Brinks. After enjoying his Pastrami melt, Cameron goes back to his camper to find it has a flat tire. Cameron is worried the remaining $794 of the “loan” his
Aunt gave him won’t last long after fixing the flat tire. But Ethan comes to his rescue and offers to help. 
In the end, Marcellus expresses his concerns for Tova. It has been three days since he saw her after the fall she took on the stool. We learn that he has three hearts. Two that control his lungs and gills, and the other he refers to his “organ heart” that powers everything else. He avoids being in the large tank with the sharks because his organ heart stops while he is swimming. Crawling is easier on his circulatory
system. He prefers “life in a small box”. 
Marcellus said “But when the cleaning woman fell from the stool, I was not swimming. And yet it stuttered”. (His organ heart)

# Chapter 29-32 
## Summary
Despite the flat tire, Ethan's friend offered to haul Cameron's camper to Ethan's house. While the two sat down for some drinks, Cameron asked Ethan for a job in order to get the tire fixed and pay aunt Jeanne her money back. Ethan couldn't offer him a job but knew of a job that his friend was looking to fill. The next morning, Cameron heads to the aquarium for an interview with terry regarding a maintenance position at the aquarium. Despite the unusual encounter, Terry offers Cameron the job. As he waits for Etha to pick him up he receives a call from John Hall who happens go to work for Mr. Brinks.
As Marcellus waits for the perfect time to eat the rock crabs he cannot wait for Cameron to start. The floors have been dirtier than ever since Tova has left.
Cameron begins to feel the effects of working at the aquarium, he had no idea how much the job was going to take a toll on his body. However following his first paycheck, Cameron was able to fix the tire of the camper and decided to drive it to Sowell Bay's main commercial block in hopes of finding Simon Brinks. Despite his efforts, Cameron has no luck finding Simon at the building. Instead he encountered a realtor by the name of Jessica. With some heavy convincing, he managed to convince Jessica to help find Simon. While waiting for Jessica to track down Simon, Cameron encounters Avery, a young woman who worked next door. Soon Jessica walked out with an address and wished Cameron good luck in finding Simon.
Tovas prepares the necessary things she needs for the application of the house. She is surprised at how much it needs to do a simple application.

# Chapters 33-36
## Summary
The clatter that Tova heard when she approached the entrance to the octopus enclosure was Cameron, who was wielding a broomstick at Marcellus, who was up on a shelf outside of his tank. Cameron discovered Marcellus trying to escape out of the back door he had left propped open. As Tova entered the room she scared Cameron, who was clearly in a state of panic. She pushed past Cameron and climbed on top of a table, eye level with the great pacific octopus. Marcellus extends his arm and wraps it around Tova’s. She makes her way to his tank, where Marcellus safely enters.
Where did this woman come from? Cameron soon learns that Tova and Marcellus have a special bond, and he agrees to keep their secret. Tova is grateful for how clean Cameron has kept the aquarium and admits that she is there to see her friend, Marcellus. “Conscience doth make cowards of us all,” states Cameron. It strikes Tova, as this is her son Erik’s favorite Shakespeare quote from Hamlet. Tova spends time with Cameron in the aquarium after hours and vows to show Cameron how to make friends with Marcellus. 
We learn that Marcellus feels imprisoned in captivity, not being able to have the thrill of hunting in the open seas again. He studies every move the visitors make, and observes each person. He expresses an observation he has between a father and son, but in reality the father has no genetic relation to the son. “I am very perceptive, perhaps beyond the bounds of your comprehension,” says Marcellus. He has spent his one thousand three hundred and twenty-nine days in captivity perfecting his observations. The chapter ends with him saying “...the young male who has recently taken over sanitation duties is a direct descendant of the cleaning woman with the injured foot.” 
In the final chapter we learn that Cameron has managed to keep his job at the aquarium and start paying Aunt Jeanne back.  He hasn’t made friends with Marcellus but he is enjoying his time spent with Tova. Ethan confesses he likes Tova and son has passed away in a boating accident back in the 80’s. Cameron and Ethan don’t find Simon and their adventure ends as the truck gets stuck in a rut in the road. Cameron was able to use his offroading knowledge to get them out of the road.

# Chapters 37-40
## Summary
Marcellus believes sea creatures are masters of deceit. He claims even his own ability to change colors, is a falsehood at its core. However, in this chapter Marcellus explains how he is getting older and older. His ability to camouflage is a lie that is on his last legs. He can feel every one of his cells struggling to carry out typical functions.
Tova attends Mary Ann Minnetti's farewell luncheon that was thrown by her daughter Laura. At the luncheon Tova shares that she will be helping Cameron out at the aquarium before her move to Charter Village. As many continue to arrive at the luncheon, Tova is surprised to run into Adam Wright, the gentleman who helped her at the park and Eriks old friend.
While at the luncheon, Mary Ann is surprised to find out that Tova will be selling her house. The idea of Tova being alone has become a topic of conversation. On his way out, Adam decides to bring up memories of himself and Erik. Tova is unsettled when she finds out that Erik had a girlfriend at the time and she was unaware of it.
Cameron meets Avery at her house as they get ready to go paddleboarding for their first date. While Avery finishes getting ready, Cameron steps inside the house and is greeted by Marco; a teenage boy with shaggy dark curls and the same olive complexion as Avery. As the two head down to the water, Avery shares with Cameron her relationship with Marco's dad. The two spend time at the water but before heading back, Avery draws herself close and kisses Cameron.
In chapter 40, the idea of Erik having a girlfriend continues to dawn on Tova. Despite knowing Erik to be a popular kid, she knew he was selective in who he dated, which drove Tova even more curious to know who this girl was. She tries to call Adam to see if he happened to remember the girl but with no luck she had no way of contacting him. In the meantime, Tova received an offer on the house but still couldn't get her mind off the idea of a girl she had no idea about.

# Chapters 41-44
## Summary
Tova insist that Cameron and Marcellus are going to be friends. Cameron is not so sure. One night at the aquarium with Tova's instruction Cameron dips his hand into the icy cold waters of Marcellus tank. He wraps his tentacles around Cameron's arm and explore his hand. With another tentacle, he reaches out of the water and taps Cameron on the shoulder, surprising him. It was as if Marcellus was showing Cameron a playful side to his character. Later, on in the evening, Cameron shares with Tova that he did not grow up with his mother as she struggled with addiction. Instead he was raised by his Aunt Jeanne.
Marcellus is fearful that Cameron and Tova will not see their connection. He says " I cannot bear to leave the story unfinished, as it is now. As I fear it will always be, if I do not intervene to help them realize." He hates that Tova's heart has a hole in it. And will do whatever he can to fill it.
We later learn that Tova is going through her belongings, preparing to move to Charter Village. She cannot help but think about the items she will leave behind without extended family to pass them onto. But it keeps going through her head. There was a girl. A girl who might have eventually been a daughter-in-law. Tova was beginning to feel hopeless in ever finding out who this girl was, until she ran into Sandy, Adam Wright's lady friend from the luncheon.
Sandy shares with Tova that the girls name was Daphne. And after doing some more digging in an old yearbook, Tova finds the name. Daphne A. Cassmore. Another piece of Erik's past has been uncovered.

# Chapters 45-48
## Summary
Marcellus brags about keeping Cameron on his toes, he explains that he does this for his own good. He began a mission of getting Cameron's drivers license, just like the one he has in his collection now. During his mission, Marcellus began to feel weaker than ever, he began to question if he'd make it in time to say goodbye to Tova.
Ethan continued to question how he knew Cameron. After hearing his last name "Cassmore" the thought of where he heard that name continued to linger. Then out of nowhere, he remembered that in the '90s, if you had a bad check (check bounced) at the store, you'd get put up on a wall. There is where he remembers "Daphne Cassmore." It was easy to link Daphne to Cameron and he confirmed this with a premium membership on an ancestry website. Ethan decides to pick up the phone and invite Tova over to dinner to share the news.
As Cameron parks his trailer at Ethan's driveway, he begins to reflect on his journey. Then abruptly at one in the morning he receives a call from his aunt Jeanne. In the call, aunt Jeanne thanks Cameron for sending her the money he owed her and more. He notices aunt Jeanne has had a drink or two, but he says that once finds Mr. Brinks he will make him pay for everything he owes him and they can get a down payment for a house. Aunt Jeanne wasn't too fond of the idea and told Cameron to let it go. Cameron was upset and decided to say goodnight.
Tova arrives at Ethan's house and makes it clear to him that this is not a date. As the two are having dinner, Cameron walks in and asks to speak with Ethan in regards to the conversation he overheard Tanner talking about. After directing Cameron to the living room, he leaves.

# Chapters 49-52
## Summary
During Ethan and Tova’s “Not a Date” we read about last week, Tova decided to use a t-shirt she found under the sink to clean up after dinner. She didn’t realize it was his prized possession from a Grateful Dead concert, one of their last concerts ever. Tova feels horrible about ruining the shirt and starts looking for a replacement shirt online and finds one for $2000. She decides to drive to pick it up over 3 hours away. During her drive she receives a phone call from Patrick at Charter Village asking about her final deposit for her upcoming move next month. Tova authorizes Patrick to process the charge so she can continue with her move to Charter Village.
After she arrives back in Sowell Bay, Tova meets Cameron at the aquarium to help clean. She was giving him directions to clean under the sea lions tail when she discovers Cameron's driver's license. As Tova holds up the license she realizes that Cameron’s last name is Cassmore just like Daphne Cassmore, her son Erik’s last possible girlfriend. The girl Tova has been looking for. Cameron starts wondering if Erik could be his father and Tova his grandmother. And his mother might have had something to do with Erik’s disappearance.
In the last chapter Tova goes to Shop-Way to deliver the new Grateful Dead t-shirt to Ethan. When Ethan opens the bag he is speechless. He knows how expensive a shirt like this is and expressed that it was “just a t-shirt”. Tova responded “It was important to you." Ethan explained that many things are important to him and he would give away a hundred shirts to redo supper at his house. 
Tova arrives at the real estate office to sign the final paperwork for the sale of the house. She learns the paperwork isn’t ready yet. She feels a bit of relief that she doesn't have to sign them today. When Tova returns home she goes back into the attic to finish packing. She puts the Sowell Bay High School yearbook in a box and can’t help but wonder if Daphne Cassmore was the last person to see Erik alive.  
“I wish you could tell me,” Tova says as she looks out over the bay. 
She closes the box flaps and seals them up with tape.
