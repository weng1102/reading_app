## Summary
At the beginning of the book we learn about Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus who was captured and brought to the aquarium in his view as a “prisoner”. A remarkably intelligent creature, who is counting down the days until his death. 160 days remain until his sentence is over.
We learn about Tova Sullivan, a 70 year old woman who works the night shift at the aquarium as a janitor. She prides herself in tidying it up while the messy visitors are away. During her shift one evening she noticed take out food containers scattered on the floor. As Tova bent down she noticed a brownish-orange clump and as she reached for it she realizes it’s a tentacle.
Marcellus is tangled in a mess of cords and shows it is displeased by slapping the ground as Tova gets near. She reassures Marcellus she won’t hurt it and was greeted by the long tentacle wrapping itself around her arm. His eye glints playfully, like a naughty childs. Once he is freed from the cords he releases himself and jets off to the hallway. Tova tries to follow but quickly loses sight of him. She questions her sanity, but notices the round circles where each sucker clung to her skin.
Later Tova meets with her women's group “Knit-Wits”. We learn her son Erik disappeared when he was 18 while working at the ferry ticket booth. One week later they found a boat that was missing from the marina washed ashore with the anchor rope cut off clean. Erik’s prints were recovered from the boat. Evidence pointed to suicide, but Tova never believed it. 
As Tova arrives home from her meeting with the “Knit-Wits”, she listens to the messages on her answering machine. One was from the Charter Village Long-Term Care center with bad news about her brother Lars.
