# Miranda Adams

Miranda is the murder victim. She is a haughty, controlling character who is often mean, even to the members of this group of close friends. The group as a whole seems to accept her ways, though some of them clearly do not understand why others are so willing to do the same. For example, Miranda is often mean to Katie but Katie is critical when Miranda is mean to Emma and advises Emma not to put up with it. Looking back on their relationship as the novel comes to a close, Katie says she did not always like Miranda, though she did love her.

Miranda is married to Julien and they are considered the golden couple with the perfect marriage. Appearances are important to her and she works at ensuring that she is always at the heart of the action. She provides drugs for the group the night after their arrival, though she had planned to save them for New Year's Eve. She brings them out a day early because she wants to be in control of the evening's events.

Miranda knows that Mark has always had a crush on her and she seems to enjoy that attention. She taunts Julien openly and seems to enjoy his reaction. She makes an entire conversation of how attractive she finds Doug even though Julien is sitting beside her. During a game of Truth or Dare, she says she has had sex with someone at the table, but does not reveal to the group that it was Giles. Miranda is furious when she learns Julien has been having an affair with Katie, and more so when she realizes Katie is pregnant. She immediately threatens to reveal Julien's insider trading to officials as a means of revenge.

# Emma

Emma is a sociopath who murders Miranda. In the scene in which Emma kills Miranda, she admits to several things, including that she set out to make Mark like her only in order to gain access to the group of friends so that she could be close to Miranda. While the core characters of the group have been friends since college, Emma is a newcomer, having been obviously involved with them for only three years. She reveals, however, that she has been stalking Miranda, emulating every aspect of her character, for more than a decade.

On the surface, Emma seems to be an unassuming young woman who is content as Mark's girlfriend and who is willing to put up with Miranda's occasional cruelty. In truth, virtually every aspect of her adult life has been prompted by her desire to be Miranda's friend. She was heavy with dark hair when she began her career at Oxford, but dieted and changed her hair and clothing styles to match Miranda. She learned to cook because Miranda made comments about the limited choices on campus. She has taken small items over the years and Miranda realizes that Emma is the person who has stalked her only when she finds those items.

In the true nature of a sociopath, Emma blames Miranda for pushing her to violence. She also blames Katie, saying that Miranda was so upset only because she discovered that Katie and Julien were having an affair. She fires off a shot at Katie, but hits Heather instead. Emma is charged and found guilty only of manslaughter.

# Doug

Doug is the “gamekeeper” who serves as guide and provides information to the guests at Loch Corrin. From the beginning, he is not impressed with the group of friends. Doug has secrets of his own. He was a sniper in the Marines and his entire regiment was blown up by a suicide bomber with Doug as the only survivor. A police record and the fact that he has PTSD makes him one of several possible suspects, though he did not kill Miranda. As the novel comes to an end, Doug stays with Heather as she recovers from a gunshot wound, hinting that they may have a future together.

# Heather Macintyre

Heather is a worker at Loch Corrin, but has been there only a little more than a year when these guests arrive. She knows that it is possible to be snowed in so that even emergency services cannot reach them, but she is still slightly shocked when Miranda goes missing and she discovers that there may not be help coming for a long time. She was a paramedic and was in a relationship with a fireman who died in the line of duty. In her grief, she considered suicide but wound up working at the lodge instead. Heather's true nature comes through when she sees Emma aiming a gun at Katie and jumps to push Katie out of the way. She is struck by the bullet but survives and comes to realize that her lost love does not define her and that her friends and family love her.

Katie
Katie is the only member of the group of friends who is not openly part of a couple, but she is having an affair with Julien. Katie is quieter than Miranda and Samira. She and Miranda have been friends since childhood. Katie encountered Julien in a bar by chance one night and began an affair with him, and she admits to herself that she might have done so at least partly because of all the times Miranda has hurt her over the years. Katie almost declined the invitation for the trip and as the novel comes to an end, she realizes that those friendships are a thing of the past and that it is time for her to move on.

Julien
Julien is Miranda's husband. He was a handsome, popular boy in college, but was self-centered. As an adult, he is a successful stockbroker. He is having an affair with Katie before the group goes on this holiday, and does not know Katie is pregnant until Miranda reveals it. When Miranda discovers Julien and Katie together, Julien immediately chases after Miranda, which makes Katie realize their involvement was a mistake.

# Samira

Samira has a six-month-old daughter named Priya, and is married to Giles. She is beautiful and was a wild party girl in college. Miranda is unhappy that Samira has become so serious as a mother. On a couple of occasions, Samira makes an effort to shut down arguments, putting her in the role of peacemaker though she has never been in that role before. Samira is the one who suggests the game of Truth or Dare that ends when the dares become dangerous. She does not know that Miranda and Giles had sex when they were in college, and Giles feels that Samira would not take the news well.

# Giles

Giles is Samira's husband and Priya's father. He is sometimes seen as the clown, though he, Mark, and Julien can all take the joking too far and become as unruly as children. Giles is furious with Miranda when she, during a game of Truth or Dare, says she had sex with “someone” at the table. Though she does not name him, Giles feels that someone might figure it out.

# Nick Manson

Nick is closer to Katie than any of the others. He attends this meeting with his boyfriend, Bo. Nick becomes hostile when Mark suggests that Nick and Bo will not go hunting with the others, and makes a point of asking if Mark makes that assumption because Nick and Bo are gay. Nick does not seem to be particularly invested in the friendship even before this holiday, and it is clear that even his friendship with Katie has run its course.

# Bo

Bo is Nick's boyfriend and is a recovering drug addict. When Miranda provides pills for everyone, Bo naturally declines. When Miranda is very drunk in the very early hours of New Year's morning, Bo accompanies her inside and offers comfort. Miranda is grateful but then makes a rude comment about his addiction, ending Bo's kindness.

# Mark

Mark is Emma's boyfriend though he has always been infatuated with Miranda and sought out Emma because she resembles Miranda. As the novel comes to an end, Katie says Mark has already found another woman with the same physical traits. Mark is a large man and is often socially inept and sometimes a bully. He is Julien's best friend and knows about the affair before Miranda. At one point, he tries to tell her but she refuses to listen.

# Iain

Iain is one of the workers at Corrin Loch, and he seems to be an innocuous, hard-working man. Heather comes to realize that she knows very little about him and she stumbles on a stash of drugs that he is moving through the estate. She discovers that he has been working for the owner of the estate all this time. Iain seems to be on the verge of killing Heather but Doug shoots him. Iain reveals that he saw Emma murder Miranda, and that he felt he had to move his drugs because he knew the police would become involved.

# Kristin and Ingvar

Kristin and Ingvar, a couple from Iceland, arrives unexpectedly at the estate over the New Year's holiday. Their main role is to serve as distractions and to provide possible suspects for the murder.
