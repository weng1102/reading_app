# The Maggie Hope books: A very short summary 

The Maggie Hope books are a series of ten historical fiction novels set in the late 1930s and the
1940s. We’ve read three of the books.
I’m not going to summarize each book in detail, just explain the historical events covered and
tell how the significant fictional characters evolve.
Set during World War II, the main character is a young American woman who is living in
England:
* At the beginning of the series, Maggie is in England to sell her late grandmother’s house
in London.
* Maggie believes that her parents were killed in a car crash in London when she was a
baby. Her father was English and her mother was German.
* Maggie was raised in the US by an aunt (the sister of Maggie’s father) who is a professor
near Boston.
* Maggie is a brilliant mathematician (as was her father) and was originally going to sell
her grandmother’s house, go back to the US, and start a fellowship at MIT. But the
outbreak of the war disturbs her plans.
# Key characters:
* Edmund Hope, Maggie’s father
* Clara Hess, Maggie’s mother
* Elise Hess, Maggie’s half-sister
* John Sterling, Maggie’s on-again, off-again fiancé
* Hugh Thompson, Maggie’s other big romantic interest
* David Greene, Maggie’s best gay friend
