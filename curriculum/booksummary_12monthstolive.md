## Chapter 10

## Chapter 14
"I CAN EXPLAIN," ROB JACOBSON says as I nearly drag him into the attorney room. I grabbed him by the arm the last few feet in the hallway. In the moment, it's not where I'd like to grab him, and then squeeze.

"You told me you didn't know her," I say, getting up in his face the minute I've slammed the door behind us.

I see the guard watching us closely from the other side of the glass, seeing us nose to nose. Like I am about to drop the gloves. I wave him away. Like: Get out of my face.

"Please let me explain," Jacobson says.

He backs away from me until he has sat down on the other side of the table.

"Can't wait."

I sit down myself and carefully place my clenched fists in my lap.

"I was drunk that night," he says.

"That's your defense? To your very own 
defense attorney? You're not a college boy! You were drunk? Do you honestly think that's going to get you over on this? You're on trial for a triple homicide. One of them was that kid you were swapping spit with, you dumb bastard."

He holds up his hands, as if to cover up.

"I'm embarrassed that I was even at the Talk-house and was enough of a dumb bastard to walk out with her," he says. "And just for the record? She was even drunker than I was."

I keep my hands in my lap and wait for the urge to actually strangle him this time to subside. "Are we referring to the drunk dead teenage girl here, Rob? That ought to play really well with the jury. I'll be sure to mention that to them first chance I get."

"I was never with her again after that one night," he says.

"Trust me when I tell you: once was enough."

"I really am sorry for not telling you about it."

"You're sorry. Got it. You're sorry. There's an old legal expression that covers this, Rob. Sorry doesn't fix the goddamn lamp." I stare at him across the narrow table. "Ahearn just said there's more. Do you know what he might be talking about, or is he just screwing with me?"

He hesitates briefly. But then shakes his head. "That's all there is," he says. "She finally went back across the street, and I came to my senses enough to go home."

I lean across the table. "You better not be lying to me again."

"I didn't lie to you in the first place," he says. "It's like I said. I just held back something that embarrassed the living shit out of me and hoped would never come up."

"A distinction without a difference."

"Listen," he says, "I understand that you're pissed that you have to wait all weekend to rip into him. But I know that when you do, you're going to kill the guy."

I don't get the chance.

Jimmy Cunniff calls me around noon the next day and says, "We got ourselves a situation."
## Chapter 15

JIMMY CUNNIFF IS STANDING with Kevin Ahearn, end of the dock, Montauk Marine Basin. I see the chief of police from East Hampton, Larry Calabrese, with them. In the water next to them is a trawler with "Nick O' Time" written on the bow in a fancy Old English font.

Nick Morelli's boat.

I know it's his, or used to be his, because Jimmy told me.

"Blood inside the cabin" is Jimmy's greeting to me. "And on the deck. Not a lot. But enough."

"How much is enough?"

"It's like that judge said about porn that time," Jimmy says. "You know it when you see it."

Jimmy likes to get to it. He thinks small talk is for people who need more to do.

"Jane," Larry Calabrese says to me.

"Chief."

A good guy. Good cop. I like him a lot. Ahearn just nods.

"A perfect shitstorm," Calabrese says.

"What are the odds?" Ahearn says, squinting out at the water. "My star witness."

"Your star witness until I got to cross-examine him," I say.

"Well, counselor. Good luck with that now."

"A disappearing witness could set you up to ask for a mistrial-we both know that."

"Not happening."

"Just wanted to raise the subject."

"You plan to raise it with the judge?"

"Nope."

"Then at least we agree on something."

Ahearn somehow looks out of place here, out of court, in a short-sleeved polo and jeans and even boat shoes.

"And by the way?" Ahearn says to me. "It's like I told you in court. Morelli had more testimony to give, none of it good for you." He points at Morelli's boat now and adds, "Good fortune has goddamn smiled on the defendant in the nick of time."

"Good one," Jimmy says.

"We're not in court, Kevin. You can use his name here."

"Piss off, Jane. You know what I think? I think your guy knew it was only going to get
worse for him on Monday and maybe had the money to do something about it."

"Kill him?"

Ahearn shrugs. "What's one more?"

"Thanks for sharing, Kevin."

"How about I share that this is all pretty god-damn convenient for you and him."

"Enough!" Chief Larry Calabrese says. "From both of you! Maybe the two of you esteemed lawyers could stop thinking about your god-damn case and think about what appears to be a suspicious and senseless death here. Unless Nick Morelli took his boat out and hit himself in the head and decided to swim to New London to get himself stitched up."

Jimmy tells me the rest of it now. Another fisherman, on his way back in, saw Nick O' Time drifting out past Montauk Point a few hours ago, at about the time when a lot of boats that had gone out early were already on their way back in.

"Even if Nick's not coming back in," Jimmy says, "he ain't drifting out there, especially since nobody saw a customer with him when he left the dock."

"Anyway," Calabrese says, "the other fisherman, Ed Fournier, gets as close as he can and starts yelling for Morelli. Nada. Tries to raise him on the radio they still use."

"Good luck with that," I say.

"You know somebody does this for a living?" Calabrese says.

"Knew," I say. "An uncle. My mother's brother. Passed a couple of years ago."

"So you know the cell service is for shit out on the deep blue sea," Calabrese says. "It's one of the last places on Earth where people aren't checking their phones every two minutes."

Ed Fournier is worried now, Calabrese says, and calls the Coast Guard. They come out and find that no one is on board, and there is indeed blood inside the cabin and on the deck. They bring back the boat. The Coast Guard has its search-and-rescue boats out on the water.

"Good luck with that, too," Chief Larry Calabrese says.

Ahearn has walked away. Calabrese sees one of his cops waving at him from Nick Morelli's boat, walks over, climbs aboard. It's just Jimmy Cunniff and me now, all the way at the end of the dock. I look out at the water and think of the way my uncle Sal once described Montauk to me. A small drinking town with a big fishing problem.

I'm almost certain he didn't mean this kind of problem.

"So Ahearn turns out to be right about something," I say. "What are the odds?"

"By the way?" Jimmy says. "I don't care what else Morelli had to say about our boy. He did enough damage right after they swore him in." "Maybe it really was only going to get worse for Jacobson."

"You ever have a witness get himself disappeared like this in the middle of a trial?" Jimmy says.

"No. Though I have thought about doing it myself once or twice. I had a good cross planned, for what it's worth."

"I'm sure you did," Jimmy says. "And I planned to grow up and play centerfield for the Yankees."

And just like that, staring out at the deep blue sea, I am thinking about what Sam Wylie told me. What was happening inside me. How long I had. Did it matter that Sam had tried to give me a heads-up about when my time was going to be up? That I'd been given notice? What kind of notice did Nick Morelli get before he went over the side?

I say to Jimmy, "If there's more bad stuff on Jacobson and the dead girl, and it's for real, Jacobson knows, and he's not telling."

"You gonna ask him about that?"

"First thing."

"You know what I think about coincidence," Jimmy says.

We're walking along the dock to the parking lot.

"I do. It's your lifelong belief that coincidence is a monumental load of crap."

On my way back home I call the sheriff's office in Riverhead, tell them who I am, tell them it's urgent that I set up a video call with my client.

They say they'll ask the prisoner.

"No," I say. "Tell the prisoner."

The rest of the way back to the house I hear myself in Judge Jackson Prentice's courtroom saying that murder trials always come back to one thing.

Motive.

And if Nick Morelli had been about to hurt Rob Jacobson-hurt us-even more when he got back on the stand, who had more motive to shut him up than my client?

Maybe, I think, he's the one who's going to end up dead in the water.

If he isn't already, that is.
## Chapter 16
THEY ALLOWED ZOOM MEETINGS between lawyers and prisoners during COVID and are still allowing them, now that all these new variants seem to keep showing up and scaring everybody like it's the beginning of the pandemic all over again. Just not scaring me the way it did at the time, not anymore. There's no known vaccine for what is ailing me.

So now here Rob Jacobson is on my laptop screen, trying to act shocked about Nick Morelli. At this point I can't tell whether or not it's another pose from somebody who has been BS'ing people his whole life.

Maybe even me.

"What?" he says when I finish. Going for indignant now. "You think I've got a hit man on speed dial?"

"I don't know, Rob. Do you?"

"You're the one who's such a bear on motive and opportunity," he says. "Where's my motive say if I didn't know what Morelli was going to say next?"

"Maybe you did know. And let's face it, he'd said plenty already."

He lets that one go.

Instead he says, "And where's my opportunity from a jail cell?"

I sigh, loudly enough to rattle the windows.

"Rob. You're rich as shit. And look at how easily you hired a hit man like me. Whether you did it or not, you had the means to do it."

He shakes his head, as if somehow he's going too fast for me.

"You have this all wrong," he says.

"Do I?"

"I couldn't wait for him to get back on the stand so you could rip him a new one. Why would I do anything to deprive you of the chance to do it and myself of enjoying watching you do it? So I can set myself up to get charged for another murder after I've beaten the rap on this one? Give me some credit."

I let that go. I am at my desk in the spare bedroom I use as a home office. Using a MacBook Pro I refuse to trade in, even as old as it is, and even though it's as heavy as a block of concrete compared to the newer, lighter models.

I used to joke that I'd die before my laptop did.

It seemed much funnier at the time.

"What else did Nick Morelli know about you and Laurel Gates?" I ask.

He smiles. Of course he has a mouthful of perfect white teeth. But every time he does smile like this, going for the big one, he reminds me of a coyote I ran into one night in the Springs, when I was making another training run on the trail. The coyote showed me his teeth that night, scaring the holy living hell out of me. There was a brief standoff, both of us frozen in place, only one of us scared out of her wits, until he ran off into the woods.

I remember that killer smile now.

"You mean you want me to share the real and intimate details of my relationship with Laurel?" Jacobson says.

I suspect that he's playing. But I don't give him the satisfaction of acting surprised. Just wait.

"Well, guess what? There aren't any intimate details beyond the ones you know already."

"You're certain of that?"

"You have to believe me on this one."

No, Rob. Actually I don't.

"You need to understand something," I say to him. "If you had sex with an underage teenage girl, now deceased, and if Nick Morelli told Kevin Ahearn, you are the one who is screwed. And there is nothing I can do to unscrew you."

"But I didn't," he says.

"And you had nothing to do with Morelli's boat basically coming back without him?"

"We went over this."

"Humor me."

"Hard no on that as well," he says.

"You better be telling me the truth."

"To quote my hotshot attorney, who said anything about the truth?"

He smiles again. Same coyote smile as before until he gets up out of his chair and walks away.

"Zoom meeting has ended," I hear him say in the background.
## Chapter 17
AHEARN GIVES A SUNDAY-NIGHT interview to Jim Acosta on CNN and tries to be cagey about what Nick Morelli's continued testimony would have been like if he wasn't missing and presumed dead.

"Are you suggesting there was even more of a relationship between Mr. Jacobson and Ms. Gates than the scene outside the Stephen Talkhouse that Mr. Morelli described?" Acosta says.

"You said that, Jim, not me."

"If there was," Acosta says, "is there a way for you to get it into the record?"

Ahearn, who is generally about as subtle as a jackhammer, tries to look coy.

"Jim, it's like I suggested in my opening statement, even if I didn't put it quite this way. Facts are as stubborn as Long Island ticks."

Instead of Nick Morelli, Ahearn's first witness on Monday morning is Officer Liam Murphy, a forensics specialist for the Southampton Police. By then Ahearn and I have met with the judge. As I suspected, he raises the idea of a mistrial because of Nick Morelli's disappearance. Kevin Ahearn tells him what he told me at Montauk, that he doesn't want one.

Neither do I.

I spent a fair amount of time-two separate pretrial interviews-questioning Murphy about the abundant amount of DNA evidence from Rob Jacobson found at the Gateses' rental house. Like an abundance of riches for the cops and for the district attorney. A treasure chest, all in all.

Too much evidence, I've thought all along.

In too many rooms.

Too pretty a picture.

Ahearn painstakingly has Liam Murphy take the jury through all of it now, as if it's a house tour.

Finally I think they're done, and I'm ready to cross, step right up and ask Officer Liam Murphy if he's ever seen this much trace DNA at any crime scene.

But Ahearn isn't quite done.

He walks back to his table, pulls a photograph and a sheet of paper out of the folder on top of a stack of papers there, walks it past the jury and up to Judge Prentice, who covers his microphone as he and Ahearn have a brief conversation.

I stand up.

"No keeping secrets," I say.

Prentice glares at me. It's already become like a default move for him, like reaching for his gavel just about every time I object.

"Not how we address the court, Ms. Smith. At least not this one."

Ahearn turns to me. "There's no secrets being kept. I'm just about to introduce some new evidence that came into Officer Murphy's possession over the weekend."

But I'm back up.

"Your Honor, whatever this evidence is, I need to see it before we proceed."

Ahearn comes over and hands me the photograph and the piece of paper. The photo is of a BMW SUV, New York plates, parked out in front of what looks very much to me like one of the chop shops across the street from Citi Field, where my Mets play. The piece of paper is the car's registration, for a two-year-old Beemer.

Owned by Rob Jacobson.

My one and only.

I hand the photograph and the registration ack to Ahearn.

"Relevance, Your Honor?"

"Mr. Ahearn believes the witness will be able explain," Prentice says. "I'll allow this.”
Ahearn walks back to the witness stand.

"Officer Murphy, could you please explain the circumstances of this car ending up in the possession of the police," Ahearn says.

"I got a call on Saturday morning from R&D Metals, which is a, uh, car warehouse on 126th Street in Queens, across from where the Mets play," Murphy says. "The car had been dropped off there last week by a, uh, anonymous third party, and sold for cash. Apparently transactions like this happen that way all the time. No names. Just money. But before they stripped the car and attempted to sell it for parts, someone at R&D decided to check the VIN and discovered that the car was once owned by the defendant."

"Objection," I say. "This is a fascinating tutorial on chop shops. But what does it possibly have to do with this case?"

"If the court will allow me to continue," Ahearn says, "I believe I can establish the relevance Ms. Smith is seeking."

"Overruled," Prentice says to me. To Ahearn he says, "Continue."

And now I am helpless, and defenseless, knowing that I am about to learn what the jury is going to learn, in real time. Any lawyer worth anything will tell you the value of discovery, and what a useful tool it can be. Right up until it smacks you upside your head.

"Please explain to the court the findings from your forensic analysis after the car was towed out to Southampton," Ahearn says.

I'm watching Murphy. Some cops like having a spotlight on them. Some, but not all. Murphy isn't one of them. He looks like he wants this to be over.

"Well, we found a lot," Murphy says, "fingerprints and such, even though there was no way for us to know how long the automobile hadn't been in the defendant's possession."

"It was stolen two years ago," Jacobson whispers.

I write this down on my legal pad. "Shut up. Now."

"Were you able to identify any of the fingerprints?" Ahearn asks Officer Murphy.

"Yes, sir, we were."

Crew cut. Square jaw. Pale blue eyes. Central casting for today's role of honest, earnest cop. Serving and protecting.

"And can you please tell the court who they belonged to?"

"The defendant," Murphy says, "which was no surprise because it was his car."

"And who else?"

"Laurel Gates," Officer Liam Murphy says.

I'm out of my chair and objecting, not even sure what I'm about to object to. But before I do Ahearn quickly asks, "And where did you find Miss Gates's fingerprints?”

"In the back seat," Murphy says. "In places that would indicate she was lying down back there."

"You had an objection, Ms. Smith?" Judge Prentice says.

"I'd like to approach, Your Honor."

He waves me forward. Ahearn is in lockstep with me as I head up there.

"I don't even know where to begin."

Prentice covers the microphone again. "Try."

"This is bullshit," I say, right before Prentice reaches for his gavel, overruling my objection, and Kevin Ahearn says there is one more piece of evidence he'd liked to enter into the record.
## Chapter 18
OFFICER MURPHY IS GETTING to the good parts now. Because the evidence is a pair of panties.

Which he testifies are Laurel Gates's panties.

Pink.

Such a joy.

"Your expert and scientific opinion is that these panties did in fact belong to Miss Gates," Ahearn says.

As if he doesn't know.

It's actually a lowrise thong, in the plastic baggie that he's proudly just held aloft as if carrying the Olympic torch. The kind of lingerie that I occasionally look at but never buy. Just in case I might be the one caught dead in them someday.

"Miss Gates purchased a similar pair at Bonne Nuit in East Hampton, two years ago this Fourth of July," says Officer Murphy, as eager to please as ever. "But that wouldn't be enough for me to reach this conclusion, of course."

Of course not.

"The more important piece, if you can call it that, is some hair belonging to Miss Gates that we found in these panties."

"Convenient," I say.

"Was that an objection from you, Ms. Smith?" Ahearn says.

"More of an observation," I say. Then add, "Withdrawn."

Ahearn turns back to Officer Murphy. "Where did you find Miss Gates's undergarment?"

Oh, go ahead, I think. Call it a thong, you dirty boy.

"Wedged into the space between the seat back and the seat," Murphy says.

Ahearn says he has no further questions but reserves the right to redirect.

I walk toward Officer Murphy, who's been having such a nice day. But that's about to change.

"So you found this particular article of cloth-ing in the place where people, oh, I don't know, sometimes find loose change in the back seat?"

"I suppose," Murphy says.

"But stuffed in there pretty tight. Am I right?"

"You could say," Murphy says, as if wondering where I'm going with this.

"Did you spot them because of their hot-pink color," I say, "or did you go looking for them?"

"I noticed a tiny bit of them, I guess you could say. And the color was, is, quite noticeable."

"But wedged in there pretty good."

"I think I already testified to that."

I go back to my table and sit on the end of it and cross my arms.

"Let me ask you something, Officer Murphy.

Clearly the inference from both you and Mr. Ahearn, because of where Miss Gates's panties were discovered and because her fingerprints were where you said they were, that an act of, shall we say, sexual congress must have occurred between Mr. Jacobson, it being his car and all, and Miss Gates."

"I didn't say that. Neither did Mr. Ahearn, as I recall."

I ignore Murphy.

I smile.

"You ever do it in the back seat of a car, Officer?"

Ahearn bellows an objection and Prentice gavels me into silence and informs me once again that if I don't watch my language, I am on the road to a contempt citation.

"Let me ask this another way," I say to Murphy. "Is the jury supposed to believe that in a moment of unbridled passion"-I give a quick look at Jackson Prentice III and shrug helplessly "this young woman took the time to hide her panties? For what, Officer? To recycle them later like a water bottle? Or just save them for a rainy day?"

"I'm not sure what you're asking me," Murphy says.

"Sure you do. Unless I'm alone in thinking they were planted."

"Is there a question there, Your Honor?" Ahearn says.

"I think I've already got my answer."

I'm not done with Officer Liam Murphy.

Before I am, we have taken a chain-of-custody trip together, and I've had him explain reluctantly, I feel just how many people could have had access to Laurel Gates's body once it was discovered the night of the murders, all the way to the morgue in Riverhead.

Along the way, I establish how easy it is, using a methodology known as dusting, for someone who knows what they're doing, to transfer fingerprints, or plant them, using powder that sticks to the oil on the tips of our fingers. I do it as quickly, and plainly, as possible, knowing how even the most thoughtful and dedicated jury members find their eyes glazing over when the subject is science.

But I am generally making the planting of prints sound as easy as taking a cookie out of a jar.

"As a forensics expert," Murphy says, almost proudly, "I can tell you it's not as easy as you're trying to make it sound."

I smile again, as if it's suddenly Christmas morning.

"As someone with a bachelor's degree in forensic science," I say, "I can tell you with great certainty that it is in fact that easy."

My degree is actually in criminal justice. Minor in forensics. But that's for me to know and them to find out. I'm not the one under oath here.

"One last thing. As the first one on the scene the night of the murders, were you ever alone with the body of Laurel Gates?"

"What are you implying?" he says.

I am so happy in the moment I want to kiss him. Just because of how defensive he sounds.

"Why, I'm not implying anything, Officer. I'm just asking a question."

"Well, yes, I was," he says. "But not long enough..."

He sounds defensive for a second time, like he's trying to clean something up. He realizes how he sounds. And the jury knows what it just heard.

I step in closer to him as a way of cutting him off.

"Long enough for what?"

"Objection," Ahearn says and Prentice sustains it.

"Withdrawn. Just one more question, Officer Murphy. From the time you did show up at the house that night along with other responding officers and right up until this moment, haven't there been enough Southampton policemen with access to the body of Laurel Gates to form a conga line?"

Ahearn bellows an objection. I withdraw one last question. But this time I've gotten the last word in right before five o'clock, sharp.

When I sit back down, Jimmy Cunniff is where he's been all day, in the first row.

I motion him to lean forward.

"You know what we weren't talking about there at the end?" I whisper to him. "Women's underwear."

Jimmy grins and whispers back.

"Like Ahearn lost his panties just now.”
## Chapter 19
THE GUY JACOBSON IS a complete mutt. Doesn't mean that he did it. Jimmy hopes he didn't, because he knows how much it will kill Jane if he did. She can always give you all the predictable lawyer BS about everybody deserving the best possible defense - usually meaning her - whether they committed the crime in question or not.

But with all her heart, and this girl has some heart, she doesn't want Jacobson to have done it.

Neither one of them do, because who wants to throw down with somebody who could have done something like this? But Jane takes these things more personal. Jane's the best there is, but she always wants to believe that she's better than someone who could get off a mutt that actually did it.

Whatever it happens to be.

Especially this Jacobson.

Like after the old tight-ass judge called it a day, before Jacobson would go back to his cell, Jimmy and Jane alone with him in the hallway, Jacobson trying to explain away not telling her about the stolen car, not thinking it mattered in the whole grand scheme of things, even if it was stolen right around the time of the murder.

More crap coincidence, Jimmy was thinking as he listened to the guy go on and on.

And on.

"It's just more of the setup," Jacobson finally said to Jane, as if Jimmy were not even there.

Jimmy couldn't listen any longer or sit this out.

"Gotta say, somebody must hate you a whole hell of a lot to go to this much trouble on a frame this elaborate."

Jacobson cocked his head to the side, a curious look on his face, as if surprised that Jimmy were even there.

"People hate me for who I am and what I have," Jacobson said. Giving Jimmy one of his big-guy smiles. Lots of teeth Jimmy once again wanted to knock down his throat. "I mean, even you hate me, don't you, Jimmy?"

"All due respect?" It always makes him want to laugh even when he's the one saying those words, knowing nothing good ever comes after them. "You're not important enough to me to hate.”

"But you absolutely love the money I'm paying you and Jane, don't you?"

"With or without your pants on?" Jimmy said, and left the two of them there.

For the time being, Jimmy has done as much as he can do for Jane on the Jacobson case. Maybe tomorrow she'll want him to try to find out how the BMW got to the chop shop, even knowing that there is about as much bookkeeping at places like that as there is with drug deals.

It's the new case that has the old cop in Jimmy jazzed and running hot.

He remembers the feeling, and likes it, especially now that Gregg McCall is on the phone, telling him to get to Mineola ASAP, that they might have a suspect who might be good for the Carson murders. It's an ex-con, name of Artie Shore. After he served out his last sentence, aggravated assault, at Green Haven, he went back to work for his old friend Bobby Salvatore.

"With whom Hank Carson was in over his nead."

"Like the deep end of the pool and he didn't now how to swim."

"It would have been helpful if your cops had und all this out a long time ago," Jimmy says. But you already know that."

"It's like I told Jane: my guys didn't dig deep ough at the time," McCall says. "Carson anaged to do a good job keeping his head down with his friends and neighbors about his gambling, so they just Keystone Copped their way into the narrative that the Carsons walked into a burglary in progress and whoever it was they walked in on lost his shit and shot them all."

McCall tells Jimmy they will have picked up Shore by the time Jimmy gets to Mineola. It's be-cause, McCall says, a witness has come forward who suddenly remembered, all this time later, having seen Shore come out of the Carson home on Kildare Road the day before Hank Carson was taped up in the ER at Winthrop University Hospital of Mineola for three broken ribs.

"Can I sit in when you talk to the guy?" Jimmy asks McCall. "Shore, I mean."

"You can't sit in," McCall says. "But you can sit on the other side of the window."

By now Jimmy is heading for the LIE, stepping on it.

"Guys like Salvatore, it's always the same," he said to McCall. "And for the guys working for them. If they kill you, they never get their money. So if it's Bobby Salvatore who had this done, there might be something more than a gambling debt going on here. Unless the debt was worse than we even know."

"We'll talk about it when you get here."

McCall calls him again as Jimmy is finally getting on the Meadowbrook Parkway.

"There's a problem."

"Shore did a runner?"

"I wish."

"You say a problem," Jimmy says. "How big a problem?"

He has a bad feeling about where this is going.

"Shore's not dead, is he?"

"Well, not yet.”
## Chapter 20
AS SOON AS I get home from court, I decide to take a trail walk in the Springs.

Not a run tonight. No gun and no shooting, even if I am feeling an urge to shoot something.

Just a long walk on my private trail.

The temperature has dropped again, so I throw on my old maroon BC hoodie. My plan is to park the car, walk to the end of the long dirt road and back. Alone with my thoughts about my life, Jimmy on his way to see McCall.

What's left of my life, anyway.

And, I think, isn't that the almighty everlasting bitch of it all? Right now, this moment, I'm as big as I've ever been, at least professionally. Looking at a huge payday from Rob Jacobson, win, lose, or appeal. The payday for the Carson case won't be as big, I know. If I solve it, though? If Jimmy and I find out who did it and nearly got away with it? My profile goes sky-high, like I launched a rocket in the backyard.

But there's a problem with that, one that existed for me, and deeply, even before my visit to the office of Dr. Samantha Wylie:

The thought that my guy did it makes me feel as if there's more damage inside me.

Not to my neck and head.

To my goddamn heart.

Like a spear has gone through it-direct hit, right through me and out the back.

It's not just the suspicion that the bastard did it.

No, it's something even worse.

It's the fear he might get away with it.

Because of me.

Because I get him off.

You want the whole truth and nothing but?

There it is.

It's something else killing me.

Literally.

I've been thinking a lot about what I do for a living, who I am defense lawyer even before I took this case. Feeling as if there are too many times, way too many times, when I feel like I'm the one really playing defense. Precisely because of what I do and who I am. As complicated as the job can be, it all comes down to this simple fact, and no matter how noble we all tell ourselves we are:

Defense lawyers are scum buckets.

We are scum buckets as a class, even though "class" is hardly a word the rest of the world generally uses in reference to us. We defend people the world has already decided are criminals and get looked at as criminals ourselves.

Often with good reason.

Barry Slotnick. Remember him? He went, what, eleven years without losing a case? He defended everybody from Joe Columbo, all the way to the Supreme Court, to the subway shooter, Bernhard Goetz. F. Lee Bailey helped O.J. get off and Dr. Sam Sheppard, even if he didn't do nearly as well with a Jersey doctor, Carl Coppolino, accused of poisoning his wife to death.

I met Bailey a few times. Had drinks with him once. He told me there was a point in the Cop-polino case when the good doctor said, "Lee, I didn't kill my wife."

And Bailey said, "But let's face it, Carl, you didn't do very much to keep her alive."

I didn't do it.

And guess what?

Sometimes they're telling the truth.

Just not always.

Anne Bremner. Maybe you've seen her on television. She defended Michael Jackson, and Amanda Knox. Never lost a civil case in her life.

I've never lost a case. Me. Jane Smith.

Civil or otherwise.

And yet there's still something wrong with this picture. Not the whole picture. Just too much of it. Because there is always the chance that we're all using our not insubstantial skills to set a guilty person free.

I walk my private trail in the Springs and think these thoughts in the gathering darkness. What if my client really did kill three innocent people? By all accounts, it was a very nice family, even if the daughter was a bit of a wild child. What if he did take out the whole family?

What about that?

So why did I take the Jacobson case? The obvious reason is because that is our justice system. That's the way it works. Everybody's entitled to a defense. And even though it can make me sick sometimes along with just about everybody else, the system actually works most of the time.

And I do stand to make a boatload of money, and sorry for the boat reference, Nick Morelli. The stage does happen to be enormous. On top of that, the attention this is bringing to me is even more enormous. Even if I lose the case and Jacobson is convicted, my career will have changed forever. What do they talk about in the mob? Made men? I'm a made woman already just being in play with Rob Jacobson.

But when I add it all up, looking at it from all possible angles, something I'm doing on practically an hourly basis, I know it comes down to this:

Because the case against him is just too perfect.

The evidence against him, evidence that keeps coming in, is just too frickin' perfect. I've looked at it from every possible angle. So has Jimmy Cunniff, who'd be skeptical about the cards in his hand even if dealt a full house in poker.

And it's even more than that.

The question I can't get out of my head, the question that Jimmy can't get out of his head even though he'd like to drop a safe on Rob Jacobson, is this:

Why?

Why would he kill those three people? Why would he kill a teenage girl even if he was drunk enough and stupid enough to practically be making out with her in the middle of Main Street and might have had sex with her in the back seat of one of his cars even though he swears he didn't?

Makes no sense.

By now I'm at the end of the trail. Time to

start heading back.

I walk up to the tree with my target on it, am looking proudly at all the small holes in the bull's-eye and around it, when the first bullet hits the tree above me.

Definitely not a BB.
## Chapter 21 Jimmy

IT'S A SCENE JIMMY CUNNIFF knows well from his cop days, one that TV productions and the movies never get quite right. Police cars, flashing lights, roped-off lookie-loos, one rooftop sniper.

Here, outside the Eagle Rock Apartments, Jimmy spots McCall. Next to him is a tall, thin Black cop standing ramrod straight and holding a phone.

Jimmy knows the drill. One voice. The crisis negotiator's. And everybody else get the hell out of the way or else.

On the line is Artie Shore, who has barricaded himself in his fifth-floor apartment and is threatening to blow his brains out if anybody tries to get inside.

Not the movies or TV now.

Real life, Jimmy thinks. And hopefully not death.

McCall introduces Captain Jonah Johnson.

Nassau County Mobile Crisis Team. He's the point man.

Johnson puts Shore on speaker.

"I'm not going back to prison. Not happening."

"Nobody said anything about prison, Artie,"

Johnson says. "Mr. McCall here just wants to ask you some questions is all. So why don't you just toss your gun right out that window and come out here and we'll all have a talk."

Before Johnson can respond, Shore adds, "They didn't think they'd ever get caught, and now they just need somebody to take the fall."

Who's they? Jimmy thinks.

But it's not his show.

The clock is already running down. The longer it takes, the better the chance everything turns to shit.

"We need to talk, you and me," Johnson says to Shore, "but not like this."

Then Shore ends the call.

McCall pulls Jimmy aside, keeping his voice low.

"The longer this goes, the more likely it is that we're looking at a very bad outcome," McCall says.

"Well aware," Jimmy says.

He keeps picturing a clock running down, like it's the end of a game. Only this is as far from a game as you can get.

Jimmy feels as helpless as anybody out here. All he can do is watch it play out. And hope they can get Shore back on the phone.

McCall walks Jimmy halfway up the block, tells him that it's not just the visit Shore paid to the Carson home that turned Shore into a person of interest. Hank Carson and Shore had also been seen arguing at the Cornerstone Bar on Jericho Turnpike a week before the Carson murders. The bartender had finally come forward, saying that he couldn't keep quiet any longer even though he knew who Artie Shore worked for and the risk of getting sideways with Bobby Salvatore.

"Then somebody shoots up the Carson family not long after."

"Too neat?" McCall says.

"You know what they say about things that look like they're too good to be true."

Jonah Johnson keeps trying to get Artie Shore back on the phone, without success. He says he's not going to wait much longer before going in.

Jimmy thinks: You should be in there already. Nobody pays any attention to him, everybody staring at Artie's window, as he walks away from McCall, all the way up the block in the other direction, cuts across some backyards until he finds his way to Artie Shore's building, an unlocked back door.

He heads up the stairs, taking them two at a time.

Racing that clock he sees moving down toward triple zeros.

I know how to do this.

Let me talk to the guy.

He is about to knock on the door when he hears a single shot and knows he made his move too goddamn late.
