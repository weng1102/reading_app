# What's new (2025)
This section describes the latest additions and improvements to my reading companion.
## Auditory Modeling feature 
Auditory modeling is a technique used to improve my listening comprehension and speech. In general, aphasia modeling involves using visual, auditory, verbal cues to guide and produce speech. Specifically, this new feature incorporates oral cues that are initially shown, recited and then obscured to allow me to recount the model text rather than just rereading it aloud. This feature will be added to any appropriate content but should not change the existing reading method. The behavior of this feature can be modified via the settings dialog. I can practice modeling with the following:

# Personal
## My Stroke Story
[[image-entry: My stroke story, left, 20%]]
![My stroke story](mystrokestory.jpg, , , ,,mystrokevc,page)
I tell [my stroke story](mystrokevc,page) since my aphasia using this reading companion. I describe who I was and who I am since my severe hemorrhagic stroke in 2015. The speech recognition feature allows me to practice by myself. 
[[/image-entry]]
### Goal
Introduce myself and tell my story.
### Rationale
I use this when I introduce myself to others. I will be able to introduce myself better as I practice more. 
### Regimen
I can practice introducing myself everyday.
## My Strategies
[[image-entry: My strategies, left, 20%]]
![My Strategies](multimodal2.jpg,,,,, mystrategies,page)
I use [my strategies](mystrategies,page) to help me recover from aphasia caused by my severe hemorrhagic stroke in 2015. The speech recognition feature allows me to practice by myself.
[[/image-entry]]
### Goal
Use these strategies in my everyday life to I overcome aphasia.
### Rationale
I use these strategies to help overcome aphasia. These strategies were developed by my Speech and Language Pathologists.

# Applying Grammar
## Goal
Improve my sentence production by understanding the underlying syntax rules and patterns, parts of speech and sentence structure.
the sentence tenses (like past present, future), syntax rules and patterns (like arrangement, order).
## Rationale
I can improve my sentence production by relearning the rules by which sentences are constructed.
## Regimen
I can practice my sentence production everyday
## Exercises

- [Sentence Tense](grammar_tenses,page)
- [Sentence Syntax](grammar_syntax,page)
- [Sentence Structure](grammar_structure,page)
# Flashcards
### Goal
I want to improve my ability to recall verbs and including helping and linking verbs until I overcome aphasia.
### Rationale
I use these fillin exercises to practice recalling action words based on flashcard pictures until I say them. 
### Regimen
I can practice these flashcard fillins each week.

# Scene Narratives
The scenes, illustrated narratives, consist of an illustration and related set of descriptive sentences. They allow me to practice sentence completion and production by describing complex scenes with different types of exercises. The scenes are decomposed into simpler subscenes. The illustrations have unique annotated overlays corresponding to their respective subscene descriptions. These annotations guide in identifying the appropriate sentences. In subsequent sections, these labels are selectively omitted to be more challenging. 
## Goal
I want to improve my sentence production. 
## Rationale
These exercises can promote sentence production by applying a structured progression of multiple-modal word finding, sentence completion, reading comprehension, and sentence modeling to a scene, a set of related sentences. These scenes allow me to reinforce and ultimately develop better sentence production skills by practicing (and reinforcing) the following.
### Reading
I can practice with perfect oral execution for a group of related sentences. Annotations are available for the entire scene and for each subscene, respectively.
### Fill-in
I can practice finding words and constructing sentences for a group of related sentences. The possible ambiguity of the responses requires me to consider context and grammatical cues offered by the subscene description. Fill-in responses of entire scenes (labeled and unlabeled) have been omitted because the potentially confusing and overwhelming number of responses consolidated across all subscenes.
### Multiple choice response
I can practice my read comprehension for a group of related sentences. Since each question will be posed with specific context, subscenes (labeled or otherwise) will not be  needed.
### Modeling 
I can practice  producing (and not just reading) sentences for a group of related sentences. The exercise provides multi-modal cues (the visual and verbal) of the the accompanying text but obscures the text to prevent me from just reading it when responding.
Subscenes (labeled or otherwise) seem redundant and will not be presented.
## Regimen
I can practice these narratives over the span of a week.
