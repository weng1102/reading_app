# Scene Narratives
Scene narratives allow me practice forming multiple sentences related to complex illustrated scenes. The scenes are decomposed into simpler subscenes. The illustrations have overlays of numbered headings that correspond to their respective subscene descriptions to afford me more structure, if necessary.
These subscenes serve as the bases for sentence formation fill-in as well as reading exercises. 
## Goal
I want to improve my sentence formation. Scene narratives promote sentence formation by providing multiple-modal sentence completion progressions. 
## Rationale
The scene narratives allow me to express ideas using multiple sentences. If I practice these exercises with multiple related sentences, my ability to form sentences can improve.
## Regimen
I can practice these narratives each week.
