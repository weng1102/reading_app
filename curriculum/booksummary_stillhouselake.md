# Prologue 
## Summary
Gina Royal is asked to pick up her children from school after getting a call from her husband, Melvin “Mel” Royal, that he had a work emergency to take care of. However, by the time they get home, she and the children are met with flashing lights and police cars stationed in front. 
An SUV had crashed into the garage, which Gina knows as Mel’s workshop. Gina believes that the police are here for the car crash, but is proved wrong when an officer asks her to get out of the car. Gina complies to assure her children that she will be okay. Gina is taken to Detective Salazar for questioning, but the detective has a hard time believing that Gina is innocent. 
As Gina is trying to explain herself, Detective Salazar arrests her and begins to check for potential weapons. Still confused, Gina tries to explain that she has no idea what is happening as she is being taken to the garage. 
She is asked if she has ever gone in there, to which she says that only her husband has gone into the garage since it was his workshop. Detective Salazar then points to a figure hanging in the garage. Gina believes that it is a doll with realistic features before realizing that it wasn’t. It was a dead body. 
## Discussion Questions 
1. What do you think will happen between Gina and Mel? 
1. Has there been a time when you have been caught off guard by someone you know or a loved one?
# Chapter 1 
## Summary
Chapter 1 is set 4 years after the prologue, in Stillhouse Lake, Tennessee, where Gina is trying to adapt to her new life on a remote lake house, which she hopes will provide safety for herself and her children after her husband was arrested for murdering multiple young women. 
The chapter opens up with Gina practicing at a shooting range, where we learn that she passed her certification for a gun-carrying permit. As the chapter unfolds, we also discover that Gina frequently engages in multiple self-defense training sessions. Her internal monologue throughout the chapter showcases her own guilt, fears, anxieties, and the isolation that she now faces from Mel’s crimes. 
Upon leaving the shooting range, she gets a call from her children’s school that her daughter has been in a fight, which doesn’t surprise Gina. As she drives through their new town, we learn that Gina and her children have moved around several times in an attempt to live a normal life after The Event, which Gina refers to Mel’s arrest and the aftermath of his secret life. 
The three of them change their identities each time they move to avoid the public finding out about their family’s past. Gina now goes by the name Gwen Proctor and her children go by Connor and Atlanta. Even with a fresh start, Gina is constantly on edge and highly aware that they could be recognized at any moment and would have to start over again. 
After The Event happened, we find out that Mel was put on trial where he was sentenced to prison. After her own arrest, Gwen also had a trial to prove she wasn’t an accomplice in Mel’s crimes. In an effort to protect her kids, they were sent away to Maine to stay with their grandma. 
Her children only know that their father is in prison for killing some women. Gwen still keeps details about Mel’s crimes hidden from them and is fearful that she may not be able to keep his horrific actions a secret for much longer.
We also learn that the family has faced intense media scrutiny and public backlash, leaving Gwen feeling vulnerable, traumatized, and highly protective over her children. 
Throughout the chapter, Gwen reflects on her past and says she finally feels hopeful and at peace in her new home by the serene lake. However, Gwen also has to navigate her children’s emotional turmoil as they try to move on from their old life as well. 
The chapter ends with Gwen still feeling the shadows of their past lingering over them and a fear that their past may still come back to haunt them.

# Chapter 2 
## Summary
Gwen receives a message from Absalom, a hacker who has been helping the Proctor family change identities when they needed to move. He asks Gwen if they are anywhere near Missoula, which is strange since he never asks for Gwen’s location. Gwen understands that as a warning from Absalom is a sign to leave everything behind and start a new life. 
Before entering the house, Gwen takes the time to skim through the mail and sees the volatile man from the gun range, Sam, walking towards her. While he does not have any bad intent, Gwen cannot help but feel suspicious of him. 
Gwen and Lanny open the door to the house, only to realize that the house alarm was never turned on after they left. Cautiously, Gwen tells her daughter to start their Jeep as Gwen unlocks the door to a gun safe that is underneath their couch. The suspense is too much for Gwen as she worries about Connor’s safety. She flings Connor’s door open, scaring her son as she is pointing the gun at him. He comments on his mother’s paranoia, “Mom. You’ve got to stop going off the rails; you’re going to kill one of us, you know that?” 
As much as Gwen wants to tell her son that it is okay, she is also trying to protect him from the world that thinks they are criminals. The harsh words and images are too much for a boy his age. Gwen closes Connor’s bedroom door and puts the gun back in the safe. 
Gwen returns to going through the mail when she sees a manilla envelope with her name and address printed on it. It is from Willow Creek, Oregon - the last place they lived in. Gwen does not touch the envelope. Instead she uses a pair of gloves to open it, only to see a business-letter sized envelope within the manila one. It is from El Dorado, the prison Mel is being held in. Lanny then opens the letter without hesitation while Gwen is lost in thought.
Lanny is angry with her mother; Gwen had been keeping Mel’s letters from the children as a way to maintain their innocence. After all, they do not need to know how harsh his words are to his ex-wife. Mel usually sends two letters that remind Gwen of his old self - one that is kind, sweet, and funny. The third letter consists of accusations that Gwen is purposefully keeping his children away from him and that she is the actual criminal. 
The following day, Lanny continues her suspension and Connor is away at school. Gwen notices that there are two other boys that follow Connor off the bus - one about Connor’s age and the other about a year older. Gwen deduces that they must be Officer Graham’s children. She has thought about befriending the uniformed officer in the event that she needed someone at her side. 
As the family is eating dinner, there is a banging at the door, which paralyzes them into thinking something is wrong. Gwen opens the door to Officer Graham and offers him sweet tea. Officer Graham is there to drop off Connor’s phone. Gwen notes that it must be difficult to not have a smartphone as a tween when all your friends have one. 
Graham takes a seat on one of the barstools and takes in the redecorating the family did to the house. As he is leaving, he comments on the safe room that has been locked prior to the family moving in. Gwen says that it just had some water bottles in it while Graham had believed that someone was stashing something. After he leaves, Gwen cannot help but feel on edge - it was weird to have a man in the house since it reminded her of evenings with Mel before The Event. Gwen apologizes to Connor for what happened earlier, but Connor says that she has a right to be paranoid. 
Connor finds his mother outside with a glass of scotch. He admits that he didn’t lose his phone; rather someone took it from him. Connor suspects Kyle, Officer Graham’s older son, to have taken his phone, which further worries him. Just as he continues his train of thought, he stops and asks if it’s okay if he stays away from Officer Graham’s sons for a while.
Saturdays are for Gwen’s mom to call the family. Her mother currently lives in Newport, Rhode Island and talks to Gwen about her life there. It’s nothing eventful but it keeps her busy. Gwen finds it ironic that her mother wants to scrapbook Gwen’s life despite the fact that most of the pages would be articles of the trial. 
Gwen thinks about how her mother was an angel she needed the most after The Event. Lanny and Connor were sent to Maine under her care while Gwen was in trial. It was a saving grace she didn’t know she needed. Their conversation is short - Gwen keeping most of the information as vague as possible. She is surprised that her relationship with her mother has stayed this strong amongst the accusations of Gwen being Melvin’s Little Helper. Lanny says she wishes she could video call their grandmother, to which Connor says no. 
The next day, Gwen scans the internet for any stalkers when there is a knock at her door. It is Officer Graham with a detective from the precinct. The detective introduces himself as Detective Prester and asks to talk to Gwen. As they take a seat on the barstools, Gwen can feel her heart pounding in her chest with anxiety. Detective Prester says that a body was found in the lake last night and was wondering if the family had seen anything that could lead them to a possible suspect. While she doesn’t want her children questioned, Detective Prester says otherwise and that it is important to the case. Gwen assumes that it is an accidental drowning; however, the detective never said it was. 
## Discussion questions: 
1. Do you think Gwen’s paranoia is justified? Or is it being taken too far? 
1. How do you think her actions impact her children? 
1. As much as Gwen is being cautious, do you think her cynicism towards the situation is too much?

# Chapter 3 
## Summary
Chapter 3 picks back up with Detective Prester interviewing the children. Connor appears tense and nervous, since both children have developed a fear of police ever since The Event, and its aftermath. 
Connor tells the detective that he hadn’t seen or heard anything out of the ordinary. Lanny, on the other hand, remains quiet until Gwen reassures her that it's okay, not thinking that her daughter could have possibly seen anything. 
Lanny tells the detective that she saw a boat last night, which prompts the detective to ask further questions. She explains that she had her windows open in her room when she heard a big splash out on the lake. As she looked out to the lake, Lanny saw a boat sitting on the water with somebody on it. After a bit, the engine turned on and the boat left. 
Gwen is shocked that Lanny has witnessed a murder, especially in their new “peaceful” home. She begins to catastrophize their situation, imagining having to pick their lives up and move again. 
Gwen immediately starts planning their escape, noting that they might need a van for all of the stuff they have now that they have gotten comfortable and started putting down roots. 
When Lanny makes a comment about packing what they can carry and leaving, Gwen realizes the damage that she’s done to them and starts to re-think running away again, saying: “We’ll stay.” 
The following Wednesday, Gwen receives a link to a news story from Absalom. It is an article about the murder at Stillhouse Lake… The article details the victim’s description, the murder, and how the body was found. 
What catches Gwen and Absalom’s attention are the similarities in age and description of the victim and the way the killer weighed the body down with concrete blocks, not to mention the way that Mel disposed of his victims in water. 
Since Gwen plans on staying, her survival instincts kick in, knowing that she owes her children safety. While she isn't running, she knows she needs to prepare, buying a van from Javi. 
Gwen trades her beloved Jeep and $1,000 for the van. Javi is a bit suspicious on why she would trade in her Jeep, asking her if she’s in any trouble or on the run. Javi assumes that they are victims of abuse, running from her ex-husband and offers her resources and help. 
After assuring Javi that she doesn’t need his help, Gwen gets a frantic call from Lanny. Lanny says that Connor wasn’t in class and that she can’t find him anywhere, telling her mom that she needs her. 
Upon arriving home, Gwen hugs Lanny and makes some phone calls to find Connor. Lanny is worried that her dad may have found them, but Gwen’s worry is for other people finding them. 
While Gwen, Lanny, and Javi brainstorm where Connor could be, there is a knock at the door. Connor stands in the doorway with Sam, who says that he found Connor sitting on the dock alone, bleeding, and cleaned him up before walking him back home. 
Gwen is skeptical of Sam but invites him to chat outside on the porch. Sensing her hesitations, he explains that he is renting the cabin up the hill for 6 months while he writes his book. Gwen comments on both Javi and Sam’s experience in the Marines and Air Force. 
After small talk and some awkward silence, Sam gets up to leave but notices of the loose shingles on the roof of their house. He offers to fix it for her and then heads out.
Towards the end of the chapter, Connor makes a similar comment to Lanny’s about packing up and needing to move away again. To this, Gwen reassures Connor and says that if she decides to move again, it will be because it's the safest thing for all of them. 
Connor shares that he got punched by some bullies, not wanting to specify exactly who hit him, and switches the conversation to talk about his dad. He shares his mixed feelings about the loving father who raised him and the monster who was revealed. 
Gwen empathizes with Connor and reflects on the impacts that he’s had to deal with thus far. She states that she is well-aware that her paranoia is a part of her huge desire to never give up control, even though this same impulse could be hurting her children. 
As she cries, she realizes that she needs to think about her children and what they need; someone who will stand her ground and trust that they will get through this without running again. 
The chapter closes by revealing more details of Mel’s crimes. Mel states: “The smartest ones are never found out. I never would have been, except for that stupid drunk driver. Our lives would have gone on just the same.” 
He targets Gwen in his next line: “It’s your fault I’m where I am, though.” We learn that while the investigation was taking place, Gewn received a call from Mel’s secret storage unit. 
He used a pre-loaded credit card under Gwen’s dead-brother’s name to store an array of small plastic bins, neatly labeled with each victim’s names containing their clothes and belongings. 
Along with the bins was Mel’s journal. After discovering strong evidence, Mel’s charges went from a single count of abduction, torture, and murder to multiple counts. In spite of this, Mel refused to exonerate her from his crimes, prompting Gwen’s own trial.
## Discussion Questions: 
1. How does Gwen’s emotional state develop through the chapter? 
1. Are the similarities between Mel’s murders and the body found in the lake suspicious? 
  1. Why/Why not? 
1. Why does Gwen blame herself for the extent of Mel’s crimes and the unmasking of his true evilness? 
1. Are there any moments of foreshadowing in this chapter? ○ What do they suggest?
# Chapter 4 
## Summary 
The chapter begins as Gwen is researching Sam Cade (the man who brought Connor home). Although she is set on finding incriminating evidence she finds out he was an Air Force vet with a good credit score, no criminal background, and is not on any sex offender registry. Gwen then brings Connor to the doctor since he had gotten hurt in a fight at school and is relieved to find out that he just has some bruising. Afterward, they stop at the diner for some pie and run into Javier Esparza. Gwen asks Javi what he knows about Sam Cade and he says he seems like a nice guy but offers to look into it if Gwen is concerned. 
Javier comments that the perk of being the range master is that he has gotten to know everyone in town. Gwen becomes a little suspicious because she remembers Sam Cade saying he is new to town and plans on moving at the end of his six-month lease. Gwen finds this troubling, like someone who is always staying one step ahead of trouble. 
They begin to get to know each other as they eat. Gwen notes that he seems to have a life that is, “Small, self-contained, but real and vital.” Cade explains his lease is up in November and he’s unsure where he will go once it ends. Gwen asks him what he is really doing here, and Sam becomes standoffish, reiterating that he is writing a book. He then asks her what she is doing here and accuses her of being skittish and standoffish. 
Gwen takes his response as a deflection and becomes more suspicious of him. She replies, “Oh I am standoffish. And as to why I am here I guess it is none of your business, Mr. Cade.” They agree to keep their own mysteries and their encounter ends with them planning for Sam to come over to help fix her roof the next day. 
Connor becomes very interested in learning from Sam and begins to help him with the project. Sam stays for dinner that night and Connor begs his mom to let them build a deck. Gwen realizes it would be wrong to move her kids again simply for a “what if” as her son is finally showing an interest in
things and opening up. She remembers that Javi’s van is still in her back pocket if they need to leave, but she wants to stay. 
After dinner, Gwen and Sam share a beer outside and Sam asks if she looked him up on the internet. As she admits that she had researched him he says that he understands and that it is smart to be safe when you are having someone you don’t know around your kids. Though, he admits he is disappointed because he considers himself to be very trustworthy. Gwen notes the differences between Cade and Mel and how Mel would get angry at him if she didn’t trust him. Gwen and Sam realize they have similar reputations around town – being skittish and standoffish. 
Gwen notices how different Sam is from Mel and realizes she never had anything to compare him to. Her father was absent from her life and she suspects that Mel could sense this void in her, preparing for the role of a lifetime to fill it. 
Although Gwen has been making quite a bit of money online, we learn that she doesn’t need to rely on her income for money, because in the storage unit, there was a duffel bag with two hundred thousand dollars that Mel planned to use if he needed to escape. Mel had inherited the money from his parents and told Gwen that he had invested it in a mutual fund. 
Gwen explains that she turned in the contents of the storage locker to the police, but first put the bag with the money in her car. She drove across town and opened a P.O. box under a fake name, then shipped the bag to her new P.O. box. Two days after the bag arrived, Gwen was arrested, jailed, and awaiting trial. Luckily, the bag was still where she left it almost a year after she was acquitted. 
Over the summer, Lanny and Connor begin to settle in and make friends. Lanny befriends a girl named Dahlia Brown and they regularly go to the movies together and hang out at Lanny’s house. Connor becomes friends with a group of boys, who all enjoy playing D&D. Connor starts to come out
of his shell, getting more comfortable even telling Gwen that he has decided he wants to be an architect. 
Sam asks Gwen why she never talks about her kids’ father and Gwen responds that he was “vile”. Gwen becomes mute with emotions as she remembers the letter that arrived this morning from Mel, where he asks about the kids. At this time, Gwen begins to develop feelings for Sam and states that she is scared to feel vulnerable again as the last time she felt vulnerable was when she was Gina Royal. 
Gwen’s life is turned upside down again when she receives another letter from Mel, in which he writes “You know, sweetheart, the thing that I most regret is that we never got to have that house by the lake that you and I talked about so often… I can almost see it, you sitting on the porch in the moonlight, watching the lake at night. That image gives me peace. I hope you’re not sharing it with anyone else but me.” 
This letter sends a shiver down Gwen’s spine, and she suspects that Mel has found where they are and knows about her relationship with Sam. Though tempting, she refuses to move again as her kids are finally settling in and making friends after living at Stillhouse Lake for a year. Instead, she calls a number that Absalom gave her years ago as a failsafe. 
The phone rings and goes straight to voicemail when Gwen says, “ This is Gina Royal. Absalom says that you’ll know that I need done. Do it.” The next morning, Gwen calls the prison where Mel is being held and makes an appointment for the next visiting day. 
# Chapter 5 
## Summary 
After receiving approval from Lanny, Gwen decides to ask Sam to watch the kids while she visits Mel in prison. Although the kids are skeptical and know that something is wrong, Gwen is careful not to tell them that she is visiting Mel.
Gwen takes an early flight at 4 am and is very careful about what she brings into the prison. She leaves her Glock locked in her Jeep’s gun safe and only brings the clothes on her body, a preloaded cash card for $500, her phone and tablet computer, and her old Gina Royal ID. 
As she walks into the prison, everyone stares at her and the guards are very interested because she has never been there to visit Mel before. Everything is taken from Gwen and she is strip searched which she finds humiliating, but she is compliant because of how important this visit is. 
Gwen sees Mel through the glass and notices how different he now looks –covered in bruises and cuts, his right eye is completely closed, and his left eye is barely open. There are bruises around his throat with the outline of fingers visible, and his left ear is heavily bandaged. 
Gwen picks up the phone to talk to Mel who says, “I guess you got my letter.” She responds by threatening to have him killed if he plays with her again. Mel says that her internet fans are still looking for her and alludes that they will cause serious harm if they ever find her. Gwen threatens to kill Mel again, but he responds that he has always had the power in their relationship and he always will. Mel also tells Gwen that if he dies in prison, he has already set a plan for Gwen’s information to be spread online. Mel comments that he knows she’s going to run and hide again now that she has been found, and accuses her of destroying their kids by their constant moving. Gwen threatens to kill Mel once again and spits at the glass before she walks away. 
After the visit, Gwen is feeling sick with emotions and takes a detour to the lot where they used to live, which has since been turned into a park. In this park is a fountain memorial for Mel’s victims that reads: “Peace Be in This Place”. 
As she travels home, Gwen anxiously watches the cameras she set up around the house before leaving. She is on edge the entire journey back as
she thinks about Mel’s ghostly, ghastly smile at her, telling her “He’s not done. We’re not done.”

# Chapter 6 
## Summary
It’s dark by the time Gwen comes home from El Dorado. She finds Sam on the porch with a beer in his hands. He gives one to Gwen and she joins him on the porch. He asks if everything is okay and Gwen says, “Yeah. I think so. Just some business I needed to take care of. It’s done.” However, Gwen knows that these are all lies to keep up appearances. 
Sam recaps his day with the kids and mentions that the police came by wanting to talk to her about the woman found in the lake. Sam suggests that Gwen find a lawyer in the event something were to happen. Gwen thinks it might be a good idea since she could finally tell someone what has been happening under client confidentiality. 
Gwen continues to think about how Mel has her information as she greets her children. She makes a plan on how they can uproot their life and move again. Mel is expecting her to run but she is determined to not let him win this time. She thinks, “Don’t do this. You’re happy here. Don’t let him win. You have the upper hand, and he knows it. He doesn’t want to die, and you can always, always pull that trigger.” 
Gwen decides to tell Sam the truth: that her real name is Gina Royal and not Gwen Proctor. He makes the connection that she is the wife of the Kansas Horror and she explains everything that has happened until now. Sam can’t help but question her about the situation, which puts Gwen up her guard. She can’t believe that Sam asked her if Gwen killed the woman in the garage. She also confirms that she wants to be called Gwen since Gina is long dead to her. 
Sam asks if the children know about their father. They do but Gwen definitely keeps some information under wraps. She recalls the faces
of the victim’s families and how most of them showed for Mel’s trial. Only a few showed up to hers and some threatened to kill her. She also recalls how Mel was a monster during the trial; he laughed at a mother who fainted after seeing a photo of her dead daughter. 
After Sam leaves the house for the night, Gwen is already making a laundry list of things she needs to do to relocate. She messages Absalom about her situation and thinks about what she can destroy, leave behind, or take with them. However, she can’t get very far since there are knocks at her door. 
She opens the door to find Officer Graham. On another occasion, he may have been there for a friendly visit, but he asks Gwen if she can come with them to the station. She is worried that maybe Sam called the police after leaving and exposed her. She tries to get Officier 
Graham to do the questioning in her house, but he needs her to come with him. Gwen puts up her guard - she refuses to be weak like Gina Royal. Officer Graham said that things will be easier if she went with him voluntarily. 
Gwen continues to stand her ground against him and tries to close her door. The door stops and Officer Graham tells Gwen that she is suspected to be by the lake the night that the woman’s body was put in the lake. He says that he is willing to get a warrant if it means she will go with him. Gwen insists that she has done nothing wrong, but she can’t help but think that Mel is behind this. She closes the door and sees her children standing in behind her. 
“Lanny has moved in front of her brother. In her hand is a kitchen knife. It strikes me at that moment how my paranoia’s touched both of them, especially my daughter, who’s obviously ready to kill to protect
her brother, even when there’s no immediate threat. I’m so glad she didn’t get her hands on a gun.” 
Gwen takes the opportunity to think about her daughter. She might need to take Lanny to the range so at least she knows how to handle the guns if she were to get her hands on them. Gwen confirms that Lanny will take care of Connor in the event that she is gone. Connor argues by saying that he is the man of the house. 
Connor says that they should just leave, but Lanny doesn’t want to. Gwen supposes that she has been anticipating the news but can’t help herself from wanting to stay. She sees a glimmer of hope in Lanny that they will stay but Lanny just says, “Yeah. Yeah, of course we are. We have to, right? If the cops dig deep, they’re going to find out…” The only thing Gwen says is that they all need to pack a suitcase. Gwen tries to apologize but Lanny ignores her after following her brother. 
## Discussion Questions 
* Try taking the perspective of Lanny. How would this story look different? What would be the final straw for you? 
* Let’s talk about suspects. We can discuss this in the next meeting, but try to set aside some potential suspects or predictions and why you are choosing them. 
* Is Gwen more concerned about Lanny safety? Why is she glad that Lanny didn’t get her hands on a gun? 
# Chapter 7
## Summary
Gwen calls Javier to tell him that the van is ready to pick up. She thinks of what Mel would say as if he was watching her, “It’s different this time, isn’t it? You’re not just running from stalkers, or even from me. You’re running from the police now. How far do you think you’ll get once they’re really hunting for you? Once everyone is hunting for you?” 
There’s a knock on her door to see Javier there. As Gwen is trying to get the keys to the Jeep, he interrupts her, saying that he is a reserve deputy and heard on the radio that the police were looking to question Gwen about the woman in the lake. Detective Prester shows: “I’m disappointed, Ms. Proctor. I thought we had some kind of civil conversation between us. But you were about to go and run away on me, and I have to tell you, that doesn’t look good. Not at all.” Gwen feels like she’s trapped and can no longer run away from this… or whatever this is. Prester pats her down to make sure that she’s unarmed. Before she is willing to go, she asks for some time with her children. Connor is crying and she wipes his tears away - she makes them promise to look out for each other while she is gone. 
As they drive, Gwen insists that she didn’t do anything wrong, and Prester says that he never said that. The police are bringing in her to fill in some information gaps. Prester pulls out a warrant, to which Gwen laughs because it’s fake. Prester finally reveals why Gwen is under suspicion - the police received an anonymous call that revealed Gwen’s past as Gina and believe that these recent murders are a little too coincidental. 
The detective shows Gwen the photos of Mel’s murders and the woman found at the lake. Gwen does not feel anything since she had been acclimated to the horror. Prester tells Gwen that the body found in the lake was disposed of the same way Mel did with his victims,
except his victims never floated. Gwen knows the image of the woman will be ingrained in her memory forever. 
Prester then accuses Gwen of committing the murders, but how could she when she didn’t know about Mel until the garage was searched. She insists that she had nothing to do with it, but Prester thinks otherwise. Prester mentions that the girl is Rain Harrington and that Gwen better not look away from these pictures. 
Gwen then notes how Prester wants her to show a sign of weakness. His yelling is a good tactic and he switched emotions so effortlessly and quickly. Gwen doubts that he was trained somewhere rough - somewhere that really challenged him and was full of criminals: “His problem now is that I’m not one of those.” Gwen’s heart aches for the woman - not because she did anything wrong but because she is human. 
Prester accuses Gwen of working with her husband and accuses her of having a motivation to do so. Gwen admits that she was a fool when she first met Mel and never suspected anything when she was with him. She continues to defend herself, saying that she found out his crimes when the police did - when the SUV crashed into their garage. Despite this, Prester interrogates Gwen as if she was the killer. However, Gwen knows that this is no accident - someone is sending a message. 
Prester sends Gwen home late at night and Officer Graham drives her home. He says that he believes Gwen and thinks that Prester has been on a bad trail. He apologizes for tearing up her life. Javier greets Gwen at the door and Gwen insists to him that she did not do anything wrong. She wonders if this has driven Javier away from being her friend. Javier reminds her that he is a reserve deputy, so he can arrest
her if she does anything suspicious. He takes his van to drive home, calling the trade off. 
Lanny curls into her mother, hugging her knees to her chest - a position that Gwen often found her daughter in after Gwen’s release from jail. “I hate this. Connor’s scared to death, you know,” she says. “But now there’s this dead girl, and the police know who we are, and we can’t go.” Lanny is scared that Mel will find them and hurt them again, but Gwen tries to comfort her. The next day, there is another girl floating in the lake. 
## Discussion Questions 
* Describe Lanny’s growth throughout the story so far. What are your thoughts? 
* Should Javier have said something about being a reserve deputy earlier? Would that change the course of the book?
## Suspect List?
* Absalom

# Chapter 8 
## Summary 
Gwen is awoken by a scream. She bolts out of bed and throws on some clothes, running into Lanny and Connor in the hallway before telling them to stay inside. As she looks outside, she sees a small rowboat about 20 feet from the dock with two people inside it. An older man wearing a fisherman’s hat and utility vest holds an older woman with ash-blonde hair who has recoiled against him as the boat violently rocks on the water. Next to them floats a dead, naked, and mutilated body. 
The woman begins to vomit, while the man is frozen in shock. Gwen takes out her phone and dials 9-1-1. As she hangs up, she receives a text from Absalom: a link to a message board of Internet trolls that have tracked Gwen down and exposed her location. She texts Absalom that she is about to be arrested but confirms that she didn’t do it. 
Gwen begins to help pull the couple onto shore when she locks eyes with Sam Cade on his porch across the lake. They regard each other for a moment as he takes in the sight of Gwen, the couple, and the floating dead body before going back inside. A few moments later, Detective Prester is back with a swarm of police cars. Gwen feels numb, but also as though this was inevitable… as though it has been coming all along and on some level, she’s known it would. 
Gwen asks Prester to make sure her kids are alright before Sam appears again. Gwen asks Sam the same thing and explains that word about where they are has gotten out. Gwen asks Sam if he is the one who doxxed her and Sam quickly denies it, saying that he would never put her or the kids at risk. 
Gwen believes him but knows that anyone could be behind this. Sam looks away, appearing as though he wants to confess something before shaking his head and walking towards the house, where the kids run to embrace him. As Detective Prester finishes interviewing the couple, Gwen heads into the back seat of his sedan. 
Prester states that he isn’t the one who leaked her information and swears that if it was someone at the station, he would handle it. He then pulls out a digital recorder, reads her rights, and interviews Gwen. Gwen recounts the events of the morning leading up to finding the body when Prester stops her and asks her to recount her days this past week. 
Gwen contemplates and decides to tell the truth, that she had visited Mel in prison, about all of the copies of his letters in her house, and the abuse and threats that she
continues to receive. Prester nods and tells her that he’s going to have to take her to the station. As he handcuffs her, he tells her that she's under arrest for suspicion of murder. 
After many hours of questioning, Gwen is told that there were witnesses who saw her in town the day the first victim disappeared. As it turns out, she was also eating at the bakery where Lanny and Gwen stopped after school. She realizes that whoever killed the girl was watching and following them the entire time. 
More questioning resumes when another officer interrupts with a knock on the door. He tells Prester that there's been a development in the case and that he’s going to want to hear it. Before the door closes, Gwen sees a familiar white man in handcuffs being led down the hall…Sam Cade. 
## Discussion Questions
* Who do you think is tipping off the Internet trolls? 
* When thinking of suspects, Gwen noted that something important slipped across her mind but that she was too tired to make sense of it at the time. ○ What do you think this could be? 
  * Is this foreshadowing anything? 
* How do you feel about Officer Prester? 
  * Do you think he believes Gwen? 
# Chapter 9 
## Summary 
Gwen is yelling and pounding on the interrogation room door, trying to get a response when Prester finally enters and reassures her that her kids are fine and that he’ll tell her everything she needs to know. Gwen then notices that he’s holding a new, unlabeled file in his hands. Prester puts it on the table and asks: “What exactly do you know about Sam Cade?” 
Gwen explains that she ran a background check on him and he was clean, a veteran who served in Afghanistan, just like he said. Prester tells her that it's all true, that he’s a “decorated helicopter pilot who served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Came home to find his beloved sister was dead.” 
He then opens Gwen’s folder and takes out the picture of the last of Mel’s victims… the one dangling from a steel noose in the garage. Prester explains that this was Sam’s sister Callie, who was separated from him after they were orphaned in a car wreck
when they were younger. They were sent to different foster homes, where she got a full adoption, changed her name, and lost contact with him. 
The two had started corresponding after he was deployed and he came back to find that she had been murdered. Gwen realizes that Sam had been stalking her, moving into the cabin shortly after her, waiting to encounter her to seem more natural, working his way into their lives, and she had not seen a thing. 
Gwen begins to panic at the thought that Gwen Proctor was just Gina Royale 2.0, ready to fall for anything sold to her by a man with a nice face and an easy smile. Gwen’s first thought is to ask if he’s the one who killed the girls, finding it ironic that Gina Royal falls for a serial killer, twice. 
Prester tells her that Sam is a person of interest right now and is being questioned, but that he wanted to know if Gwen already knew about his true identity. Gwen tells him: “If Cade did this, then you nail his ass to the wall.” He sighs, thinks for a moment, and then opens the door for Gwen, letting her know that her kids are down the hall waiting to be taken home in the Jeep. 
Before she leaves, Prester tells her not to leave town, or else he will send the FBI on her trail to ruin what's left of her life. When she enters the room, Connor and Lanny fling themselves onto her in a hug and ask questions about what is happening and why they took Sam for questioning. 
On the car ride home, Gwen is hesitant to explain the details but ultimately decides to tell them both about Sam. As she does this, she realizes that Sam was becoming an important part of the kids’ lives and their transition to StillHouse Lake. Lanny expresses that if she had access to the gun safe, she would be able to protect them too. 
Gwen thinks: “I know what she wants: access to the gun safe. And I’m not willing to do it. I never wanted this. I never wanted to raise my kids to have to be gunslingers, warriors, and child soldiers.” As the Jeep pulls into the driveway, the headlights hit the garage, covered in a blood-red wet substance. Vivid red is splashed across the garage with vile words scrawled onto the windows, across the bricks, and the front door. 
Gwen reverses the car back up the driveway, but two cars block them in: the Johanses and a muddy red truck with three people in it, one of them being the disruptive man from the gun range, Carl Getts. Gwen starts to panic as they walk towards her and she realizes that she doesn’t have her gun. Her first thought is to get her kids to safety as the truck starts following them. And she almost makes it before the Jeep’s wheel gets caught on a gully, making them crash. 
Despite crashing, Gwen tells the kids to call 911, arms herself with a tire iron and an emergency strobe flashlight, and waits for the pickup truck to get closer. Halfway down the hill, they hit something and the truck flips over, making the drunk men stumble out of the car. As the men approach, she can tell they are all still drunk and now even more pissed off. 
She flips the stun function on the flashlight and aims it at the men, stunning them and knocking them over. The police begin to arrive but Gwen catches Carl’s gaze, “I see the hate in it. There’s no reasoning with him. And no way to feel safe.” Once Officer Graham arrives, she gives her story first, saying that they were probably the ones who vandalized their house before harassing them. 
Gwen confirms that Graham knows who she and her ex-husband are when he tells her that they were just on the way to guard her house for the night. Graham tells her that he’s only arresting the men for criminal mischief and driving under the influence, encouraging them to go back home. 
As the chapter closes, Gwen reflects on who she can trust now and where they can go, ultimately following Officer Graham up the hill to a house that no longer feels like home.

# Chapter 10 
## Summary
Officer Graham takes diligent pictures of the damage that was done to Gwen’s house and concludes that the words were written in red paint. He tells Gwen that he needs to take her guns but she refuses to do so until he has received a warrant for them. Officer Graham does not argue, and tells Gwen to keep her doors locked and her alarm on as he leaves. 
Gwen notices that Lanny has some blood on her chin and cleans her up with a towel. Lanny then does the same for Gwen and Connor is the only one who doesn’t have any injuries. Gwen sleeps on the couch, and remembers that when they were in Kansas she slept on the living room couch with a gun every night. 
The next morning Lanny comes downstairs in an irritable mood and Gwen can tell that she didn’t get much sleep. Lanny asks if Gwen has checked Sicko Patrol yet, and Gwen explains that that’s her next step. She then rolls her eyes and says, “I guess I won’t be going to school today.” Gwen agrees and adds that it might be time for them to begin homeschool. This upsets Lanny and she complains that she will never be able to leave the house again. 
Gwen asks for Lanny to help her go through her e-mails and Lanny gets very upset by people’s hate-filled messages. Gwen comforts Lanny and tells her, “You can turn off this computer and walk away anytime. They’re pixels on a screen.” Gwen explains that the odds are very low that these people will ever do any harm in person, and explains that she has the gun for protection. She offers to take Lanny to shooting lessons but respects her decision if she doesn’t want to learn. Gwen explains that guns are only useful if you need to kill, and she hopes that Lanny will never have to do that. As Gwen is making pancakes upon Connor’s request there is a knock at the door. 
Gwen opens the door to officer Kezia Claremont, who explains that her father wanted her to check on Gwen. Claremont explains, “I think I might be able to help find who is doing this to you. Because we both know it’s somebody close. Somebody local. And somebody who’s got a reason.” Gwen accuses Sam Cade of doing this to her but Claremont says that she helped confirm his alibi both times the girls went missing and is sure that it is not him. Claremont explains that if they eliminate the residents who are original to the lake that leaves them with thirty residents. She then eliminates her father and Sam Cade - which leaves them with 27 potential suspects. 
Claremont gives Gwen a list of names of these potential suspects and suggests Gwen does some of her own research. Gwen asks why she is helping her and she responds, “Because you need it and Easy asked. But also… I know what it’s like to be judged for something you never got to control.” The chapter ends as Gwen invites Claremont in for some pancakes.
## Discussion Questions 
* Do you agree that Sam Cade should have been eliminated from the list of potential suspects? Why or why not. 
* If you were Lanny would you agree to take shooting lessons? 
* Do you have any potential suspects in mind that were not discussed in this chapter? 
* How do you feel about Sam Cade, knowing that he stalked and followed Gwen? Do you think he really did fall in love with Gwen despite his prior intentions or was it all an act? 
# Chapter 11
## Summary 
Claremont explains that another reason she’s here to help Gwen is because Javier likes Gwen, though he is not willing to believe she is completely innocent just yet. Gwen texts Absalom the list of suspects Claremont has created and asks him to research them. 
Gwen gets a call from an unknown number which she decides to answer in case it is Absalom. However, Gwen’s heart sinks when she hears the voice on the other side of the phone and realizes that Mel had found her number. She recalls that she had to give the prisoner her phone when she went to visit Mel and one of Mel’s accomplices must have hacked her phone. 
On the phone Mel initially sounds sweet and rational and then turns into a monster, threatening to kill Gwen and saying she doesn’t know what is coming for her. He also tells her that his lawyer thinks that his rights have been violated and asks Gwen if she will testify this time. Gwen is paralyzed by fear and it takes a few minutes before she has the strength to hang up. She is terrified that he has all of the information in her phone, such as messages with Absalom and her kid’s numbers. 
After hanging up with Mel, Gwen calls Claremont and explains Mel’s call. As she is on the phone, Claremont arrives in her driveway. Gwen says that she is feeling suffocated, and asks Claremont if she will stay with her kids so she can get some air. She goes over emergency procedures with Lanny and Connor and promises to be back in an hour. 
Gwen goes to the shooting range and Sophie, the young woman manning the counter, looks terrified of Gwen and refuses to make small talk. Javier is a bit more friendly and tells Gwen that Bay eight is open. Javier tells her that he sold so much ammo in the past few days that he had to restock twice.
Javier asks Gwen if she knew about what Mel was doing and she replies, “No. Mel didn’t need or want my help. I’m a woman. Women are never people to someone like him.” Javier then asks Gwen why she didn’t tell him about her past and she explains that she just wanted to move on and forget about it. She begs Javier to end the questioning and says that she needs to get home to her kids. He responds, “They’re all right. Kez is watching them. She is unsettled by his tone and comes to the realization that Kezia Claremont has a connection with Javier and she was doing this for him. 
As Gwen passes Sam Cade’s house on her run he says, “Hey, we should probably talk.” Gwen asks Sam why he came to Stillhouse Lake and affirms that she wants the truth this time. He admits that he believed Gwen was guilty and wanted her to admit what she had done. However, he explains that once he had gotten to her he realized that Gwen was not guilty and that they were both affected by Mel’s abuse. He says, “I saw somebody who barely survived what she’d gone through and just wanted to keep her family safe. You weren’t…her.” 
Gwen and Sam discuss the horrific photos they had seen of his sister, Callie, and bond over how traumatized they both are from seeing what Mel had done to her. Gwen says that she should have known about Mel’s abuse so that she could have saved his victims. However, Sam finally understands what she has been through and comforts her by saying that she and her kids would have been dead if she had tried to intervene. 
As Gwen reaches for Sam’s hand, she sees through the window that there is a shotgun aimed at the back of his head. Gwen reaches for her bag and pulls out her weapon but is bewildered when she cannot find the shooter anywhere. 
Gwen puts away her gun as they wait for the police to arrive. Kezia Claremont arrives at Sam’s house and Gwen immediately panics that she left her kids alone. Gwen tries to leave and says she needs to go home to her kids, but Claremont won’t let her leave until she completes her investigation. 
Gwen asks Claremont if she had been at the house with her kids before she arrived at Sam’s house. She responds, “No, I had to respond to an officer down, up on the main road. All hands. I was just coming back when I got this call. Sorry. But I had knocked and told them I was going before I left. Your daughter said they’d be fine.” 
Sam asks, “Was there an officer down,” to which Claremont replies, “No. Couldn’t find anything.” Gwen immediately panics thinking, “It strikes all of us that the report and even the shootings here… those were diversions.”
Claremont rushes to drive Sam and Gwen home. Gwen screams for Lanny and Connor and panics when there is no response. After Sam goes into Connor’s room he becomes silent and whispers, “Gwen.” As Gwen sees that Connor is not in his room and that there is blood on his twisted sheets, pillows, and on the floor. 
Claremont holds Gwen back from entering his room and says that she needs to be careful so that people do not mistake her being there as evidence for her committing the crime. Claremont calls the police, explaining the details of the case. 
As a last resort, Gwen checks the safe room. She is sickened to find blood smeared on the padlock. She finds that the panic room is wrecked inside- “bottled water scattered across the floor, knocked from a shelf, and a box of emergency high-protein supplies has been knocked over and spilled packages across the floor.” Additionally, there are drops of blood, long strings that show motion, and Connor’s sign that reads Caution: Zombies Here. Furthermore, there is a crossbow broken on the floor and the phone was ripped out of the wall and broken in the opposite direction. 
Gwen realizes that this means Connor and Lanny had been hiding in here, but they are now gone. She is interrupted as she gets a call from an unknown number who asks her, “Do you think you got away with these crimes?” Gwen demands for him to give her back her kids, to which he is bewildered and it is apparent that his call had other intentions. The man quickly hangs up the phone. 
Prester soon arrives and asks Gwen what had happened and she begins to explain everything. 
## Discussion Questions 
* Why did Sam wait until Gwen was in Stillhouse Lake to confront her? 
* Who do you think the shooter is? 
* What do you think was the original intention of the call Gwen received at the end of the book? Do you have any suspicions of who this was? 
* How have your feelings towards Sam Cade changed over the course of the book?
# Chapter 12 
## Summary 
After finding her children gone, Gwen is speechless. Breathless even. Her house doesn’t feel like a home anymore because it is absent of the one thing that makes any kind of home for her. Prester questions Sam and Gwen in detail, but Gwen isn’t paying attention. Her sole focus is getting her children back and alive. She has to believe that they are okay to prevent herself from thinking the worst. 
The questioning becomes too much for Gwen, and she becomes angry at Prester - mad at him for making it sound like she killed her children. “I’m not Melvin Royal. I’m not even Gina Royal. I am the person I had to be to save my kids from the people who wanted to hurt them and still do.” Gwen begs Prester to look at the information that she has found and thinks that Mel has been working with a partner. 
But Mel doesn’t have a partner. He didn’t need one. People tried to pin it on Gwen to be his partner, but he didn’t need one. Rather, he has followers. His cult-like charisma made him a leader and would love to have someone act as his puppet. 
Prester says that he already looked into possible leads and the shooting at Sam’s house. Gwen comes to the realization that her children are still alive, but it may not be for long. I’m still forgetting something, but what that is is unknown. “It’s something I’ve seen, something that didn’t make any difference, and now I can’t slow my mind down enough… It’s about Connor.” 
In the meantime, Gwen messages Absalom about her children and asks him for help. There is no reply and Prester puts her phone in a cardboard box for evidence. She is then taken back to the police station for interrogation. 
At the station, Prester tells Gwen about the roadblocks, the dogs, and the search parties that he sent out to find the kids. She isn’t too hopeful though as rain had started to pelt the windows of the van as they drove. The rain would wash away the evidence, if there was any. 
Prester confirms that Gwen’s alibi has been checked and lets her out the door, but before she could leave, Officer Graham offers to accompany her. He apologizes for being late to support her, but she disregards it as his kindness is the something she needs at the moment. Rain showers them as they enter the SUV. 
Gwen asks where they are going when the door locks with a soft pop. He asks her if she still wants to meet with Sam as she feels her phone vibrate. It’s another troll, to which she ignores, but Graham still praises her for being a good mother. Another message comes through from Absalom - U have a cop living close. I checked. Good resource. This is strange to Gwen since Absalom told her to never trust a badge. 
The drive continues with talk about the weather. Graham tells Gwen that there’s a jacket in the back that she could wear to keep warm. She grabs it, only to feel a slimy substance on the bottom of it. It’s blood. She then comes to the realization of what is happening, but she tries not to show it. 
Graham says that the blood is from a deer that he and Kyle had killed on the way over. He meant to clean it, but he had dumped it at his house before going to the station. Gwen thinks about it - how he is quick to have a reason for the blood, how nuanced and friendly Graham is, and how numb she feels when he talks to her. Gwen remembers the day he came to her house to drop off Connor’s phone, or rather an identical phone that could listen in on the family. It could have had a camera in it that watched their every move. It could have recorded the tones to figure out the passcodes. 
She has no time to panic though. As she replies to Sam’s message, the SUV is lurched to the side and the phone goes flying. Graham grabs it and smashes it. The voice as he shouts angrily is reminiscent of a theater actor. Gwen opens her backpack and feels the case of her gun. She can’t panic - she needs to think - she needs to know where her children are. Graham apologizes and calls Kezia to tell her what happened. A true theatrical act. 
Graham takes Gwen to where he dropped Sam off to search for the kids. She is aware that he’s playing a game with her. The part that he likes is the waiting, the control, and the manipulation. The SUV hits a huge bump, making Gwen lose grip on her backpack; Graham picks it up and puts it in the back seat. Gwen needs to think of options. She reaches over to grab Graham’s radio, to which he grabs her hand. If she is quick enough, she could punch him in the face with her other hand. She then reaches for the shotgun in the back and Graham stops her. Graham then turns on his radio and asks if there is anyone out. 
Gwen is surprised that Graham is still playing this out - He’s playing with her the way Mel played with his victims in the garage. Must be exciting for him. They reach the end of the road when Gwen has second thoughts - Maybe he is genuine and she’s reading him wrong. Attempt after attempt to get a response on the radio is futile; Graham takes it from her saying that the reception is botched anyway. 
"We’re on our own here Gina."
"My name isn’t Gina. It’s Gwen.” She tries to save herself by getting out of the car. “You don’t want to do that. You’ll just get lost out there."
He is still playing the game. I’m not. 
Gwen smashes the radio into the side of his head, and driven by rage, she hits him over and over again. The lock disengages and she lunges past him. Gwen brings her fist to his groin and then grabs her backpack in the back seat. Graham grabs the end of her jacket and she slips in the mud. She can’t let him get to her and she starts to run before the monster starts to really breathe down her neck. 
## Discussion Questions
* Why did Gwen forget about Connor’s phone? 
* Did you know it was Graham all along? What was the evidence that you collected? 
* How are Graham and Mel similar in their motive? 
# Chapter 13 
## Summary 
After fleeing from Graham and running through the cold rainy night, a chill bites through Gwen but fear and rage cover her in warmth. She’s hyper-aware that she’s all alone in the dark and Graham could be anywhere behind her. She assembles her gun and realizes that she only has seven bullets left. 
Lightning hits a pine tree catching it on fire, allowing Gwen to see Graham about 10 feet away from her. She knows that she can’t kill him by accident because she needs him alive to find where her children are. Suddenly a hot stinging spreads across her left arm… in shock, she realizes he shot her. In a spiral of despair, Gwen can feel it all slipping away from her. What brings her back is the fact she will never be her trolls’ victory and that she would do everything she could to protect her kids. 
She focuses on lining up a perfect shot to Graham, but right as she’s about to pull the trigger a barrel of a shotgun is pressed against her neck while Kyle Graham yells, “I got her dad!” She escapes from Kyle‘s grasp and tells him to run; as he does she notices he runs up the hill instead of down. Graham catches up to her and suddenly, she spots another trail, branching West. Gwen takes it but halfway down the trail she slides and slams hard into a jutting boulder, her head bleeding badly. Gwen thinks to herself “No. I’m not dying here. I’m not.”
With blood still seeping from her head, she takes out her gun and continues down the path, brainstorming ways to get help while also anxiously twisting behind her to see if Graham is following. As she approaches the truck, a flicker of movement catches her eye making her freeze in place. Lancel Graham is lying in wait…he’s taking Mel’s classic ambush predator approach, where he’d crouch in a spot by a car and wait for the woman to approach before attacking in a rush like a praying mantis. Graham may know her ex-husband‘s habits, moves, and strategies but he doesn’t know her. She survived Melvin and she’s going to survive this asshole too. 
If Graham likes to play games, she could play a game too. She makes her way around the trees and gets into character, looking weak and falling over in the mud. He approaches her carefully until he circles closer and closer saying, “Stupid woman, he said you’d fall for this shit. Get your worthless ass up and I’ll take you to your kids.” As she makes a move to stand up, she fires a shot through his right shoulder, the bullet going exactly where she wanted it. Graham retorts, “You were supposed to be easy.” Gwen replies, “Gina Royal was easy.” 
She offers to let him live if he tells her where the kids are, to which he replies: “They aren’t yours. They’re his. And he wants them back. He needs them. This isn’t about you, Gina.” And when he least expects it, she steps forward and pushes him backward. His feet go out from under him, and his weight falls back onto the sharp point of the same branch she almost fell victim to. 
Gwen gives Graham one last chance to tell her where her kids are. He hesitates and suddenly looks scared and vulnerable. Melvin. The moment Gwen tells him that Mel doesn’t care if he lives or dies, he breaks. He explains that the kids are in a hunting cabin that belonged to his grandfather, with his boys watching them. 
She takes his keys and phone and heads to his truck. As she’s about to call for help, she stops on the list of A names, recognizing Absalom. The magnitude of deception sinks in on her. The game of it all. Absalom, the former troll who became her only constant ally, someone who took her money and made them new identities helping them relocate. He could direct her exactly where he wanted her to go. They’ve been helping Melvin all this time, moving her like a chess piece, setting her up, and knocking her down. 
When Gwen finally gets a hold of Claremont, she sounds frantic, asking where Gwen is and if she’s okay. She explains that she knows where her kids are and asks Claremont if she knows where the cabin is. She also realizes Sam is in the car as he questions her with concern. Sam assures her that her kids will be okay, that Kez has the location ofthe cabin, and that they’re on their way to her. With the wound on her head still bleeding, it becomes harder to fight the weakness and dizziness, and giving into the tiredness the last thing she says (or thinks) before everything goes very dark is: My kids. 
## Discussion Questions
* How do you think Officer Graham and Mel got in contact? 
* What do you think Graham wanted to do with Gwen? 
* Why do you think Mel wants/ needs the kids? 
* Did you ever suspect Absalom to betray her?
# Chapter 14 
## Summary
As Gwen wakes up, she finds Sam and Kezia putting bandages on her head, which is bleeding profusely. Gwen immediately asks for someone to take her to the cabin, but Sam demands that she goes to the hospital. However, Gwen refuses and Sam eventually gives up and agrees to go with her to the cabin. 
Gwen realizes that her text had not gone through to Sam, and she asks how he figured out that Graham was bad. He explains that Graham did not show up for the search, and Kezia realized that he took a full day off during the time of each abduction and again on the days they think he disposed of the bodies. 
After hearing Kezia yell, Lee Graham pokes his head out of the cabin and asks where his dad is. Kezia tells him that his dad is okay and in the hospital and asks him to put his gun down. Lee comes outside and explains that he didn’t want to do any of this and that he doesn’t want to get in trouble. He reveals that Lanny and Gwen are inside and explains that he told Kyle that they shouldn’t have done this, but they couldn’t say no to their dad. Lee reveals that Kyle is still inside and is armed with a rifle.
Despite disapproval from Kezia, Gwen enters the cabin with her Sig. Kyle fires a shot a Gwen that misses her by fractions. Lee is now standing in a perfectly learned shooting stance and is holding a handgun pointing at Kezia’s back. Lee’s shot goes just barely wide and Kezia turns low and fast. She advances on Lee and yells at him to drop the gun, and he convulsively throws it away. 
Kyle opens the door and aims the gun straight at her face, although she has time to shoot back she is unable to, remembering that he is just a boy. Sam tackles Kyle from behind, and Kezia puts both boys in handcuffs. Gwen runs back into the cabin to look for her kids and finds a trapdoor that leads her to a room which is an exact replica of Mel’s garage. Gwen screams, as she realizes that Graham never meant for her children to live, just for her to see this.
To Gwen’s utter disbelief she hears Connor whisper, “Mom.” Gwen throws down her gun and realizes that her kids are in a barred grate that is set into the false wall that is padlocked. Gwen takes a crowbar and to lever the door and finds Lanny and Connor alive, and immediately embraces them. Kezia and Sam find them shortly after, and Gwen thinks about how hard it must be for Sam to see a replica of the place where his sister was killed. However, Gwen can only focus on how relieved she is that her and her kids are alive.
## Discussion Questions
* Do you think that Lee actually felt conflicted about what he did to Gwen’s kids, or it was just a set up to trap Gwen?
* Why do you think Graham created a replica of Mel’s garage?
* Are you surprised that Graham and his sons are guilty?
* Do you empathize with Graham’s sons, or do you think they are just as guilty as their father?
# Chapter 15 
## Summary
Gwen finds out the blood in her house was from Kyle, and it was Lanny’s doing. She explained that she grabbed the knife and cut Kyle and would have gotten him if Graham had not also been there. Lanny and Connor are ashamed that they let Gwen down, but she wants them to know how proud she is that they stayed alive. 
Gwen realizes that Connor was so upset when Kyle took his phone because he had put the passcode to the safe in his notes, against Gwen’s instructions. Lanny and Connor do not share anything that happened to them at the cabin, and Gwen can’t help but wonder if they are hiding something. 
Detective Prester arrives and says, “I owe you one hell of an apology Ms. Proctor.” He prepares to search the basement and tells Gwen that he will need Graham’s phone for evidence. She reaches for his phone and freezes as she sees a message from Absalom that reads, “He wants an update.” Gwen realizes that Absalom has been selling her out the entire time and is the reason they have been found each time they moved. Prester asks who Absalom is referring to and Gwen is terrified to even say Mel’s name aloud.
