# What happened to me
[[image-entry: I had a stroke, left, 20%]]
![my stroke](mystroke.jpg), ![David and Robert](MommyDavidRobert.jpg)
- I was a CEO presenting to my board when I had my stroke.
- I had a severe hemorrhagic stroke in September 2015.
- About 13% of stroke survivors were like me.
- About one out of three died within 30 days.
- About 25% survive five years
- I was initially in a coma for a week. I woke with right side impairment and severe aphasia. I could only speak one word: “after”.
- I spent two months in hospitals.
- I feel lucky because more than one third of hemorrhagic stroke victims do not live passed the first few days and up to two thirds do not live a year after stroke.
