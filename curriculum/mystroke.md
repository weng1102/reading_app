My name is Ronlyn Goo.

I had a severe hemorrhagic stroke in September 2015. About 15% of stroke survivors were like me.

I studied Chemical Engineering at UC Berkeley. I worked at Dow Chemical.
Then I went to Stanford GSB for an MBA.

After Stanford, I was a management consultant.

I was a CEO presenting to my board when I had my stroke. I was initially in a coma for a week. I woke with right side impairment and severe aphasia. I could only speak one word: “after”.

After spending a month in the neuro ICU, I had a month in the stroke recovery word. Then I had transitional rehab at home followed by nearly 400 out-patient therapy sessions.

Now, I attend Voices of Hope for Aphasia at “Name That Song”, Aphasia Book Club where we are currently reading Where the Crawdads Sing, art, reading and writing group, chat and exercises.

I also attend SPARC at San Jose State. On Fridays, I have 1:1 Speech Therapy, Book club reading Hidden Figures, and Aphasia choir.

I also attend ATP at Cal State East Bay. On Mondays, I have Book Club at Becoming by Michelle Obama, Wednesdays: Brain Games, Tuesday/Thursdays exercising, Fridays with Choir.

I attend Nova Southeastern with “Stories of Perseverance” and other.

I attend Aphasia Recovery Connection & Lingraphica, Stanford Bingocize, International Aphasia Movement, Backstroke Sing-Along, Sing Aphasia, Healing Strokes Art Therapy, and Aphasia Game Night.
