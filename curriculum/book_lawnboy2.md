# The Social Thing
Desperate to acquire new friends, I soon started taking lunch regularly with the coffee roasters out on the lawn, even though I hated them. No more thirteen-dollar sandwiches, though. Even if I could afford them now, it was the principle of the thing. The roasters—Dallas, Austin, and Houston—not only ordered overpriced sandwiches, they ordered frilly sides, like saffron deviled eggs and pickled watermelon rind, and they washed it down with three-dollar bubbly water. They looked at my ham sandwich the same way the Mexicans used to look at it, with a sort of thinly veiled contempt.
“You know that’s not even ham, right?”
“Says ham right on the package.”
They’d snigger, which was the closest I’d ever seen them get to actual mirth. Austin almost seemed to have a personality. When I told him I was a topiary artist, he seemed impressed, albeit in a not-very-demonstrative way. I told him about my mushrooms and my pom-poms and my hot-dogeating elf, and of course my merman, though I didn’t mention the erection.
“You should come check it out,” I said.
And to my surprise, he actually consented to have a look. So, after work, Austin hooked his fixed-gear bicycle onto the front of the metro bus, and we made for Suquamish. It felt strange riding the bus and not reading a book. I was accustomed to having some dead guy to keep me company or at least some MFA grad, who was in love with sentences. Instead, I had Austin, who mostly checked his Facebook page while I looked out the window, thinking I should have offered him the window seat. “You read?” I said.
“What, like books?”
“Yeah.”
“Not really. You?”
“Yeah, quite a bit.”
“You must have a lot of time on your hands.”
I guess I was a little nervous. Not that I was trying to impress the guy, but when had I ever invited somebody I hardly knew to my house? I wouldn’t even let Remy see where I lived. But I figured since Austin liked dive bars, maybe his tastes extended to squalor in general, in which case he might like the res or our house.
He was visibly unimpressed by our humble abode, averting his eyes as we walked past the moss-encrusted Festiva, the tarpaulin-draped swamp cooler, and the bevy of broken shit strewn willy-nilly under the sagging canopy—everything from engine parts to empty bleach bottles. He seemed particularly uneasy about leaving his bike out front. And of course I couldn’t blame him.
Freddy had his fat taco parked on the sofa next to Nate, watching WreckIt Ralph with his Gibson knockoff bass propped in his lap. It had to be getting on my mom’s nerves having him around, the way he was always in the house, eating Cheetos in his underwear. But now that I’m employed, the writing is on the wall for Freddy.
“Freddy, this is Austin.”
Freddy played a couple farty notes on his bass before giving Austin a stony-eyed once-over.
“Boy, how come you wearin’ your sister’s pants?”
Austin glanced over his shoulder to make sure Freddy wasn’t talking to someone behind him. “Uh, hey.”
“Don’t look like no lumberjack to me. Why you wearin’ all that facial hair, boy—that to keep you warm?”
“Um . . .” Austin appealed to me with his eyes.
“Ever swung an ax?”
“Don’t mind Freddy,” I said. “And that’s my brother, Nate.” “Hey,” said Austin.
Nate belched under his breath, never taking his eyes off the screen.
“Don’t mind him, either. C’mon, I’ll show you my merman. You want some grape soda or anything?”
“I’m good.”
“Stay out of my grape soda,” Freddy called after us.
I took Austin out back and showed him my work. The pom-poms were a little rough around the edges, and my merman was a bit shaggy from neglect, but as far as I could tell, Austin was mildly impressed.
“I’m thinking of adding a little school of sucker fish near the bottom of the merman,” I told him. “You know, like circling suggestively around him or something.”
“So, like, this is ironic, right?”
“What, you mean because mermen don’t really get erections?”
He sniggered at that, shaking his head bemusedly, while running his fingers lazily through his beard. I was hoping he’d have more questions about my merman, but he only fished out his phone and checked Facebook again.
“You sure you don’t want some grape soda?”
“Nah.”
“Let’s walk down to the Tide’s Inn,” I said. “It’s a dive—one of the diviest, actually.”
He checked the clock on his phone and petted his beard some more.
“Nah, I gotta hit the road here pretty quick.”
“You want a bong toke?”
“Nah, I’m good.”
“We could walk down to the pier. You like fireworks?”
“Not really.”
Austin was a tough nut to crack. His curiosity didn’t seem to run very deep. But I’d be lying if I said my heart didn’t sink a little when he left ten minutes later, following a few more stilted exchanges.
I’ve never been much good at the social thing. And that’s actually rare for siblings of special-needs children. We usually have to develop strong social skills in order to help our siblings navigate a world that is generally unprepared to accommodate them. I was pretty good in that respect. I made sure Nate didn’t get arrested when he dropped trou in the middle of a traffic island. I made sure he didn’t shoplift or smoke cigarettes or do any of the other stupid things I did. I acted as his liaison and translator and diplomat. I read to him, I made sure he ate, I made sure he dressed warm. You’d have to call me a good brother. But in every other respect, I was a dud socially. How else would I end up with a best friend like Nick?
# TMI
On Saturday night, Nick swung by and picked me up in his beloved Honda, House of Pain rattling the windows as he pulled up to the trailer. His love for bad hip-hop, like his love of that stupid Accord, is every bit as irrational as his fear of Mexicans and gays. He’s already sunk a ridiculous amount of money into that car. Nothing on the damn thing is stock. The muffler belongs on a drag racer. The spoiler belongs on a Formula 1. The LED hubcaps spin to no discernible purpose.
At Tequila’s, we got in a round of darts, in which he beat me handily—as usual. I’d lost what little dart mojo I’d ever had, but I didn’t care. Though it was the first time I’d been there in weeks, I was sick of Tequila’s, weary of the jukebox, tired of smelling the bathroom, sick of the ubiquitous neon and the endless repetition of SportsCenter, and most of all, done with the nagging hope that somehow tonight would be different, that something or someone would magically walk into my life, because I was in the right place. As though Tequila’s in Poulsbo could ever be the right place. “So, what’s new?” he wanted to know. “How’s the new gig?” “Repetitive,” I said.
“Well, that’s the idea of a job, Michael. The minute it stops repeating itself, you’re out on your ass.”
“I guess so.”
“Hey man, I might be able to score us some tickets this season—fiftyyard line, yo. Some big-shot contractor with like four different trucks says if I hook him up on some all-season Toyos, he’ll give me a pair of tickets to the game of my choice. What do you think, Cardinals? I love watching
Arians lose his shit.” “Just not the Rams,” I said.
“Hell no,” he said, taking a healthy pull on his beer. “Oh, hey, I got a joke. What’s the difference between a fag and a refrigerator?”
“I don’t want to know.”
“A refrigerator doesn’t fart when you pull out the meat.”
“Nick, I said I didn’t want to know.”
“What is it with you?”
“What about you? Why are you always bashing people? Mexicans, fags, lesbians, I don’t get why they offend you so much. What did a Mexican or a fag ever do to you?”
Nick doesn’t answer, just sips his beer irritably.
“Seriously, I just don’t get it, Nick. You don’t even have a reason.”
“Duh, Michael. Look around. They’re taking all our jobs. They don’t pay taxes.”
“Fags don’t pay taxes?”
“No, dumbshit, illegals. And for your information, they’re not normal.”
“Mexicans?”
“No, fags.”
“What’s normal, then, Nick? Tell me that. Your porn habit? The way you talk about women?”
“Oh, like you don’t watch porn?”
“Actually, no.”
“You’re a liar.”
“What if I told you I touched another guy’s dick?” I said.
“Pfff.” Nick waved me off and turned his attention back to his beer.
“What if I told you I sucked it?”
“Will you please just shut up already?”
“I’m dead serious, Nick.”
“Well, I’d say you were a fag.”
“I was ten years old, but it’s true. I put Doug Goble’s dick in my mouth.”
“The real-estate guy?”
“Yeah.”
Nick looked around frantically. “What the fuck are you talking about,
Michael?”
“I was in fourth grade. It was no big deal.”
Cringing, Nick held his hands out in front of him in a yield gesture.
“Stop.”
“He sucked mine, too.”
“Stop! Why are you telling me this?”
“And you know what?” I said. “It wasn’t terrible.”
All the air went out of Nick, and he looked at me dully, his face a prairie of blankness.
“This is a joke, right?”
“No, Nick, it’s not a joke.”
“So you’re saying you’re a fag?”
“I doubt that. It’s been twelve years since I touched a dick. But that’s not the point.”
Nick looked genuinely troubled. Averting his eyes to his beer, he looked just about as thoughtful as I’ve ever seen him look.
“So, wait,” he said. “You’re not, like . . . in love with me, are you?”
I swear, I almost punched him. “Fuck no. How could I—or any other guy
—possibly be in love with you?”
“What is that supposed to mean?”
“You’re still missing the point, Nick.”
“No, why wouldn’t a guy love me?”
“Never mind,” I said. “Just drop it.”
“You’re wrong, asswipe, I happen to know gay guys like me. I’ve caught them staring at me.”
“How’d you know they were gay?”
“They were gay.”
“How’d you know?”
“They were staring at me, dipshit. It was in the city. Of course, they were gay.”
“Okay, so assuming they were gay—” I said.
“Shhh!” he said, glancing up and down the bar.
“How did it make you feel?”
“Like kicking their asses.”
“C’mon, honestly. What did it feel like?”
He scratched his neck and looked vaguely in the other direction. “It didn’t feel like anything, Michael.”
“You were flattered, weren’t you? Admit it.”
“Fuck off.”
“Just admit it. It didn’t really make a difference, did it, if it was a dude or a woman? Either way, you felt good about yourself. You felt wanted.”
“You’re sick, you know that? There’s no way in hell you’re gonna make a fag out of me. Is that what you’re trying to do?”
“Is that what you think this is about? Believe me, Nick, even if I were gay, I’d have zero interest in you.”
“Good.”
“You hate women, you hate Mexicans, you hate gays—”
“I don’t hate women.”
“You hate these people because you’re scared, Nick.”
“Bullshit.”
“Because you’re insecure about your own intelligence, your own sexuality, your own measly job. Because you—”
And just like that, Nick stood up without a word and walked out of Tequila’s. The truth is, I was glad to see him go. But still, I couldn’t believe it. I’d never seen him leave a full pitcher like that.
# Family
I was pretty shit-housed by the time the bus dropped me off a little after midnight. When I got home, I could hear Freddy in the shed, thumping away on his bass while watching, one could only assume, vintage porn. Mom was at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette. There was no sneaking past her, so I ducked my head into the kitchen.
“Hey, Ma.”
“Hi, honey.” She smiled, so I could see her conspicuously white crown. The shadows played hard on her face. Despite the weariness, I saw an old spark of genuine satisfaction, too.
“You want to sit down?” she said.
“Nah, I’m beat. How was work?”
“Not too busy,” she said. “How’s Nick?”
“He’s good.”
“Tell him to come around more often.”
I could tell she wanted me to hang around and talk for a while. But then I’d have to tell her about Nick walking out on me, and I didn’t want to disappoint her.
“Well, good night, Ma.”
She tapped her cigarette and picked up her tumbler. “Good night, honey.
Could you remember to take a look under that sink?”
“You bet, Ma.”
I stumbled into the bedroom and plopped down on my half of the disembodied bunk bed without taking my clothes off. The room spun slowly counterclockwise, to the tune of Nate snoring.
I got to thinking of Nick, way back in seventh grade, when he practically lived with us. His mom and dad were fighting constantly. Two or three times, the cops showed up at their house, and once they even hauled his old man off to county. Nick never talked about it, but we all knew that his dad roughed him up regularly. Don Colavito was a mauler. I’m pretty sure it’s the reason Nick always tensed up when you touched him unexpectedly.
I’m also certain it’s why Nick goes by his middle name, Nicholas, and not his first name, Donald.
My mom treated Nick like one of her own, even though she had more than she could handle already. He was one of us, eating bruised bananas and crackers in front the TV while Mom was at work. He’d still be there when she got home with pizza and breadsticks. Some nights he didn’t go home, and it was a rare night when anybody came looking for him.
And then there’s the fact that Nick’s been like a brother to Nate, too. He’s spent countless hours in front of the TV with him, eaten a gazillion Big Macs with him, read a million books to him, stuck up for him in high school, though Nick was younger and a hundred pounds lighter. And he’s never once run out of patience with Nate.
I’m not defending Nick, exactly. It’s just that no matter what a narrowminded dickhead he is, he’s family. All these years, I’ve had no choice but to accept him, in spite of his bigotry and shallowness and willful ignorance. No matter how deep the infection runs, family is family. The only other choice is to cut them off like rotten limbs. 
# Like Butter
Having affixed my final bobblehead for the day, I was filing out the door behind Thing One and Thing Two when Chaz stopped me out front by the dead ficus. I assumed he needed me to start his car again.
“We need to talk,” he said. My ears started burning.
“You got time for a beer?”
“Uh, maybe,” I said. “Let me call Freddy.”
“That your boyfriend?”
“No. Not at all. Kind of a roommate, I guess.”
“See what you can do, Muñoz. Razmachaz is heating up. I need to start getting you up to speed.”
Though Freddy let me know on no uncertain terms that he’d have to shuffle some things around (presumably his nuts), he was willing to cover me on one condition.
“Pick up some chips on your way home. The cheesy kind. None of this baked-rice shit.”
“Got it,” I said.
“And get some grape soda at the Masi.”
“They don’t carry it anymore.”
“Orange, then. The name brand.”
“There’s only one brand.”
“Shouldn’t be too hard, then, dog. Just don’t be late. I got shit on my plate.”
“Yeah, yeah.”
“And remember: cheesy.”
I heard Nate going ape shit in the background.
“Gotta go,” said Freddy, hanging up.
Just as I’d suspected, Chaz needed me to start his car, the driver’s side of which was caked in dry mud.
“Yeah, I kinda got stuck the other night,” he said. “You got a license, right?”
“Yeah.”
“Good. You drive today.”
“You’re sure?”
“What the hell,” he said, riffling through the glove box for a mini.
Man, the transmission on that Bimmer was like butter. It was one thing to sit shotgun in the BMW. Driving it was something else. I truly felt like another person driving that car. I would’ve gladly driven all the way to Spokane right then if I’d had the chance, but Chaz directed me about a mile south and instructed me to park on a side street, where we climbed out and started walking toward the center of town.
After about four blocks, we stopped at a Mexican restaurant called Isla Bonita on the main drag and went straight for the bar.
Move a few walls around, get rid of the sombrero behind the bar, and Isla Bonita could’ve been the Tide’s Inn or Tequila’s. The stale air, the queasy light, the hoarse laughter. Within ten minutes, I’d be hearing Lynyrd Skynyrd. The bar patrons were a pretty rowdy crowd for five fifteen on a Monday afternoon. I recognized these people. They were not your characteristic islanders. They were my people. They hung Sheetrock and mowed lawns. They drove delivery trucks and repaired hot tubs. They lived fiercely and kept their blinders on and didn’t look much past their next paycheck. People with grease under their nails and name patches on their work shirts and deep worry lines at the corners of their eyes. People who lived for the promise of a little immediate satisfaction, when they could get it. And they could get it at Isla Bonita. It was a revelation that such a place existed on the island. Chaz must have been reading my mind.
“Don’t let the McMansions and the Mercedes fool you, Muñoz. Who do you think put this place on the map? I’ll tell you: loggers, berry pickers, and shipbuilders. And they weren’t all Scandinavians, either. They were Japanese and Filipino and Indian. Look at the street names if you wanna know the real story. Forty years ago, it was nothing but mom-and-pops on this island. Yeakel’s shoes, Vern’s Winslow Drugs, the Country Mouse. This place was Mayberry R.F.D.—Christ, you probably don’t even know what that is. But there was no Safeway, no Subway, no Starbucks, nothing the modern world would call culture. There were three cops, and we knew them all by name. Not only that, we knew their secrets.”
“So, you’re from here?”
“Born and raised. Class of ’83. My dad sold insurance at Farmers, my mom sold baskets and decorative birdhouses. This place was a hippie haven, Muñoz. Artists, outliers, eccentrics. It was an island in the truest sense.”
“No man is an island, but Bainbridge Is.,” I said.
“How do you know about that?”
“My mom had the T-shirt. She’s almost as old as you. I know about Mayberry, too.”
“If you listen hard enough, you can still hear the heartbeat of that place— just barely. But don’t get me started. Look, I like your style, the way you keep your shoulder to the wheel and your ear to the ground.”
I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t flattered by Chaz’s confidence in me. He was evasive concerning the precise nature of Razmachaz but kept assuring me that I was the man for the job. He was grooming me. I should be on my toes and ready to learn. Was I reliable? Was I ambitious? Did I want to escape that dump I was living in? It hadn’t yet occurred to me why on earth Chaz might have selected me to be his protégé, when Remy walked in and sat down in a booth. I felt the blood drain from my face. “You okay, Muñoz? You’re not diabetic, are you?” “I’ll be right back,” I said.
As bad as I wanted to run, I’m proud of myself for summoning the courage to proceed. I stood up and walked directly to Remy’s booth, convincing myself that I was capable of things I hadn’t been capable of the first time I sat down in her section. I was making seventeen bucks an hour now. I was the point man for Razmachaz LLC—whatever the hell it was. I was driving a BMW, sort of. And I had poetry in my heart, goddammit. But none of that mattered when the dude in the straight-brimmed Yankees cap and the big black gauges in his earlobes sat next to Remy, draping his arm around her. I immediately did an about-face, I hoped before she saw me.
I looked the other way for the next half hour, which is to say I looked at Chaz, which is to say Chaz had an audience. He told me about everything from floating payrolls, to tax credits, to money laundering. He told me how money didn’t matter, how it was just another tool, how finance should be all about freedom. Personal freedom. Freedom of choice, freedom of mobility, freedom to sit in your office and get drunk. It wasn’t that he was ambitious, more that he was lazy—and by his own admission. That’s why being an entrepreneur was the only life for Chaz. He could make his own hours. He could sleep at his desk. He could make businesses happen out of thin air, which is where credit came in.
“Hustling is overrated. It makes you bitter when things don’t work out. I’ve seen it. The key is to take risks and court luck. That way, when you fail, you haven’t got too much invested.”
Chaz then proceeded to tell me everything but the particulars of Razmachaz LLC, and where exactly the “point man” fit in, ordering numerous rounds while I watched in the mirror behind the bar as the guy in the Yankees cap kept his arm around Remy. Of course I was jealous. But more than that, I was embarrassed that it wasn’t me with my arm around Remy. It should have been.
Finally, Remy walked to the bathroom, and I ducked my head as she passed, determined to get out of there before she saw me.
“Let’s go,” I said.
Chaz tossed off his drink in a single slurp and left two twenties on the bar. I ducked my head again on the way out. I didn’t even glance at Remy as I whisked past.
“Mike!” I heard her say.
“Oh, hey,” I said, turning.
“Meet you out front,” said Chaz with a little wink.
Simultaneously disappointed and relieved not to have to introduce Chaz, I stood at the end of Remy’s booth, not knowing what to do or say next.
“This is my brother, Travis,” she said.
“Oh!” I said, a little too brightly. “Nice to meet you.”
“Right on,” he said. “Is this the guy?”
Remy socked him on the shoulder and blanched. I felt bad for her getting put on the spot like that, even though I couldn’t believe for a second that I was “the guy.”
“So, what’s up?” I said.
“You stopped coming around. You promised you’d come back and see me.”
“Well, after the whole saltshaker incident, I wasn’t sure if they really wanted us in there.”
“Anyway, I don’t work there anymore,” she said.
“Where do you work?”
“Nowhere right now. What about you?”
“I’m in production.”
“Ooh, like film?”
“More like bobbleheads.”
“That sounds cool. Better than waiting tables, anyway. How’s your novel?”
“Oh, you know, comin’ along,” I said. “Getting ready to publish it, actually.”
Goddammit, I was doing it again, digging myself a deeper hole, creating expectations I could never live up to. It’s like I wanted to fail.
“How exciting!” said Remy. “When can I read it?”
“Soon. Just needs some, you know, tuning up. Some editorial.”
“I can’t wait,” she said. “Hey, you wanna sit down?”
“Nah, my friend is waiting for me. I’ve gotta give him a lift. I better get going. It was great seeing you, though.”
I was about to make my exit, scalp tingling, heart clenched in selfcontempt.
“Wait,” she said, fishing around in her purse. She located a pen and scribbled her number on a beer coaster. “Call me,” she said.
“Uh, yeah, will do.”
I must have been smiling like an idiot when I walked out and found Chaz leaning against the wall.
He looked mildly impressed. “Funny, the whole time, I kinda figured you were gay,” he said.
“Why would I be gay?”
“I don’t know. Just a feeling I got.”
“Do I seem gay or something?”
“Not exactly. More like you don’t seem not gay.”
“Why, because I don’t have a girlfriend?”
“That could be it.”
“Well, where’s your girlfriend?”
“I don’t have one.”
“Are you gay?”
“Absolutely not.”
“Well, there you go. And besides,” I hastened to add, displaying my coaster with Remy’s number, the smiley face already beginning to smear with the sweat of my palm, “I got digits.” “Not bad,” said Chaz.
Yes, I was pretty damned satisfied with myself as we walked the four blocks back to the car, Chaz lagging behind with uneven strides, stopping once to piss in a shrub. I felt like I was actually, finally, on the verge of something.
# The Player
I treasured that coaster. I wore its edges smooth, contemplating the possibilities. I was really beginning to think Remy might be the one. She was engaging, quite attractive, and familiar enough to feel comfortable around. If I could only get close enough to Remy, I knew she would stir me in some special way, and I could get over the girlfriend hump.
But making the next move was a lot tougher than it should’ve been. Sad as it sounds, I actually wished I could’ve called Nick for advice, though I’m sure I knew exactly how that conversation would run:
“Generally speaking,” he’d say. “I’d give it a week before calling her.
But in your case, I wouldn’t wait longer than three days.”
“Why in my case?”
“She might lose interest.”
“Geez, thanks.”
“Well, Michael. Maybe you’re just not alpha material, that’s all I’m sayin’. Maybe you’re one of those sensitive guys who’s just gotta be around all the time, drinking with her while she complains about other guys and confesses a bunch of stuff. Then, eventually, she drinks too much and gives into your sensitive-guy charms.” “Dude,” I’d object weakly.
“So, assuming you’re that guy, Michael, and you probably are, I wouldn’t give it a whole week. You see my point?”
It was like having a conversation with my own ego.
In the end, I decided to wait until payday to call Remy. I did my best to dial her number breezily, as though there were absolutely nothing at stake.
But the second she answered it, I went blank.
“Uh, hey, it’s me, Mike. You know, from Mitzel’s and . . .”
“Oh, hi.”
“So, uh, I was thinking like maybe we could, I dunno, grab some kind of food or something? Maybe some pizza. Or like maybe a drink? Like a cocktail or whatever.”
“Oh, I see. You wanna get me drunk, is that it?”
“I didn’t mean—”
“Typical man. One thing on his mind.”
“No, really, I didn’t mean like—”
“And what happens once I’m tipsy? What’s your plan then, Mike?”
“I was just talking about—”
“Is that when you take advantage of me? Like in the back of your truck or something?”
“Look, I swear, I wasn’t trying to say—”
“Mike, I’m kidding,” she said. “I’d love to have a drink.”
“How about this weekend?”
“The thing is, I’m leaving for Wenatchee tomorrow to see my parents for a couple weeks.”
“Ah.”
“It’s sort of embarrassing, actually. I need to work at my dad’s hardware store and make a little money to hold me over. I’m totally broke.”
I found the news that Remy was broke thrilling. It released me from my own shame and potentially made me attractive, too, as a person who was not only gainfully employed but also soon to be the point man for Razmachaz LLC—whatever the fuck it was.
“How about the nineteenth?” she said. “It’s a Thursday.”
“Perfect,” I said. “Where?”
“You decide.”
“Uhhh.”
“You don’t have to decide now. Text me.”
When I hung up the phone, I felt slightly changed. Like I’d just made some kind of major step. Granted, I was a little late in taking it, but still it was a confidence builder.
# All You Can Eat
Three days later, Remy texted me, marking the beginning of a brief exchange:
OMG. It’s soooo hot here. Ugh.
LOL. Only 70 here.
Lucky!
I’m feeling lucky!
Don’t do anything naughty . . .
I’ll try not to!
Again, on Thursday she texted:
Looking forward to the 19th!
Me, too! It’ll be fun!
It better be! LOL.
Is that a threat?
Maybe.
And again on Friday:
I’m over Wenatchee. My dad is driving me nuts.
Hang in there.
Thanks. At least $$$ is good.
That’s good.
See you when I get back!
Not only were we flirting, not only was Remy initiating it, but we were actually developing intimacy. These exchanges with Remy, the two of us perfect strangers, really, separated by 140 miles, were about the closest I’d ever come to having a bona fide girlfriend, pathetic as that may seem. And I must say, it had me feeling bullish.
Saturday morning, Mom, Nate, Freddy, and I all squeezed into the Tercel and drove the two miles to the casino. They’ve got a huge breakfast buffet over there with an omelet bar and twelve toasters and the whole shebang. It’s called the Clearwater Buffet. We call it the Clearwallet Buffet, though. It’s the kind of thing where in order to bring Nate, you’ve got to have backup because there’s a high ape-shit probability. Too many choices, too much food. If you haven’t noticed, food is a big trigger for Nate.
For all of Freddy’s faults, he’s really good with my brother, which I’m certain is the only reason my mom hasn’t kicked him out yet. Freddy is like Nate’s sensei. At the buffet, when Nate started working himself up into a state, Freddy remained calm and made eye contact with him.
“Look here, boy: I feel your pain. They ain’t never enough blueberries in them waffles. Damn near drive a man crazy. But you a grown man, dog, remember that. Fact is, you a well-grown man. And sometimes a man gotta bear up in the face of adversity. They’s a truckload of waffles not fifty feet from here, and they’re all you can eat. You’ll get your fill of blueberries. You just relax now, boy.”
Freddy’s silky baritone had an immediate calming effect on Nate. My brother was a pussycat the rest of the morning while we heaped our plates with bacon and potatoes, and eggs any way we wanted them. Tall glasses of orange juice and bottomless cups of coffee. We gorged ourselves on bear claws and dunkers and bagels with smoked salmon. We laughed, we grunted, we farted, we sighed. I felt like a king sitting at that table, seeing everybody so cheerful. Here was the Muñoz clan (and Freddy) on a sunny Saturday morning, with actual promise on the horizon. All the restaurant food we could eat and no anxiety or guilt about the expense. My mom looked ten years younger, sitting there with no cigarette between her fingers, no tumbler of wine, her crow’s-feet turning to laugh lines before my eyes. Freddy was in high spirits, too.
“Mm-mm, I’ll tell you what, Mike Muñoz,” he said, snapping off half a crispy bacon strip. “Old Freddy could get used to this. A man grow weary
of Rice Chex and instant oats, ain’t that right, Nate?”
Indeed, Nate was lost happily somewhere between abstraction and diabetic shock. Things couldn’t have been nicer or more pleasant. And dammit, I was grateful, but a little guilty, too. I really should have invited Nick.
# Not Just Any Lawn Mower
After the buffet, Mom had to pull an afternoon shift, so Freddy, Nate, and I walked out to 305 and caught a bus to Hansville for the flea market. I had fifty-nine bucks in my pocket, and as much as I’d been promising myself I’d show a little financial restraint, I was itching to get there.
Flea markets are a glorious thing if you’re not a millionaire. There’s nothing quite like the pleasure of discovering lost treasures among life’s flotsam, unless it’s the pleasure of getting rid of rusty old shit and making a buck. It’s a win-win situation—kind of like recycling for poor people. It was a thirty-five-minute bus ride to Hansville, and the window wouldn’t open and Nate was a little gassy after the buffet. He’s not inhibited that way. On top of the drive, it was a half-mile walk to the flea market from the bus stop, a warm stretch of highway in August.
Freddy’s corduroys kept riding up on him.
“Goddamn,” he said, digging at his crotch. “It’s like a goddamn reuben sandwich down there.”
“Spare us the details, please.”
“You don’t understand, boy. I hail from warmer climes. A man’s privates gotta breathe.”
“I didn’t realize Tacoma was so much warmer.”
“I’m talking about Africa.”
“Kind of a stretch, don’t you think?”
“How’s that?”
“That was like five generations ago.”
“Uh-huh. And I suppose you ain’t Mexican?”
“Technically, my dad was born in California.”
“Uh-huh. You just keep tellin’ yourself that, Mike Muñoz. But far as anyone else is concerned, you Mexican. If it looks Mexican, and it has a Mexican name, it’s probably Mexican. Even if it don’t speak Mexican.”
There must have been forty stalls spread out in roughly even rows on the dead grass, a couple of blue Honey Bucket outhouses on the far edge of the gravel parking lot. Most people don’t realize it, but a flea market is a whole social order. First, you’ve got your pros, the ones who might actually own a home of stick construction. Usually, they’re retired. Their stalls consist of foldout tables, the kind you see in church basements. The pros have canopies for shade. They have power strips and cash boxes. Their wares are varied and many, everything from pewter figurines to frilly, old lamps. Stamp collections, books, ceramic bowls, vintage postcards, Victorian doilies. Meanwhile, your rustics and fierce libertarians, the ones whose homes probably don’t have cement foundations, operate from their tailgates, amending them with saw horses and plywood to accommodate their inventory. Their wares are also many but less varied: carburetors, chain saws, winches, wedges, mauls, old license plates, ammunition, and knives. The next rung down is the brokeas-hell working-class stall. This is your classic fire-sale scenario— everything must go: blenders, 28k modems, Foreman grills. Crock-Pots, treadmills, and terrariums. Even toys, which sort of breaks your heart. Farther down the line, your hippies operate exclusively on blankets or tarps. Candles, dream catchers, and handmade drums. Maybe a wood carving of two bears fucking. Always a sad cardboard box of records— some America, some CCR, some scratched-to-hell Steppenwolf, and maybe an old Andy Williams or Mantovani album, which belonged to their parents. By the time you get all the way down to the tweakers, you’re almost to the Honey Buckets, and there’s no more shade. You have some heavily tattooed kid with an oversized baseball cap and his fourteen-yearold girlfriend. A towel, a pit bull, and some stolen DVDs. That’s where I usually start shopping. On this occasion, I scored a bunch of DVDs for Nate, including Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Scooby-Doo Wrestlemania Mystery 2.
Farther up the line, I found a fishing rod for eight bucks and a tackle box for three fifty. Not that I fish, but I’ve been meaning to start one of these days. I always see Indians sitting on the dock downtown, with a can of beer in a brown bag, their fishing poles dangling over the edge. They never catch anything but bullheads, but it looks relaxing. I also bought another Leatherman for four bucks and, for five bucks, a Billy Bass wall hanging that lip-synched “Take Me to the River” and wagged its tail fin in perfect time. If you’ve ever seen one, you know they’re hilarious and quite lifelike.
Yes, I realize I was spending immoderately. But dammit, I needed it. The fact is, I only bought one big-ticket item: a lawn mower for thirty-five bucks. I haggled the guy down from forty-five. Not just any lawn mower, either. A Snapper 3.5 horsepower mulching mower with a thirty-six-inch deck. Green, like my old one, but in better shape.
It didn’t occur to me when I bought the mower that I’d have to push it all the way home. So, while Freddy and Nate bused back to the res, I began the journey on foot and started thumbing. After about eight steps I realized I should have sent the tackle box and the DVDs home on the bus with Freddy. Eventually, an old blue pickup with three dozen angry bumper stickers stopped for me. The driver, who wore a long white beard, watched me suspiciously in the side mirror, like a detective on a stakeout, as I hefted the mower into the bed. I was about to jump in back with the mower, but he waved me into the cab, where I squeezed in with a pair of overweight labs.
“Del Jeffers,” he said, without extending a hand.
“Mike,” I said.
“That all? Just Mike?”
“Mike Muñoz.”
“Mexican, eh? Figured as much when I saw you pushing a lawn mower.”
I was hot and tired and happy to have a ride. I wasn’t going to disappoint him by not being an actual Mexican, so I didn’t object.
“If you don’t mind my asking, how does a fella find himself pushing a mower along the side of the highway?”
“It’s a long story.”
“Truck break down?”
“Yeah, but not today.”
Del considered the information to see if it fit anywhere. “You always take it fishin’ with you like that, the mower?”
“I’m not fishing.”
“Hmph. Well then, how is it that you got yourself a rod and a tackle box?”
“I came from the flea market.”
“Ah,” said Del. “So it’s all yours, huh? The mower, the rod, the tackle, all those there DVD videos.”
“It is now. Like I said, I was at the flea market.”
“Flea market, you say?”
“Yeah.”
“Hmph. Just a coincidence, then, I reckon.”
“What?”
“Daughter’s brother-in-law got his mower stolen couple weeks back. Green, like that one. Turns out he’s quite the angler, too. Where’d you say you live?”
“I didn’t.”
“Mind my askin’?”
“The res.”
Why is it people always ask you so many questions when they’ve already got their minds made up about you? Del kept interrogating me as we passed Little Boston and Crazy Corners, and a little ways past the Indianola signal, where he dropped me on the shoulder.
“This is as far as I go,” he said.
I was still a few miles from home, but I’ll be honest, I was relieved to get out of Del’s truck. He watched me intently in the side mirror as I wrestled the mower out.
“You take care, Mike Muñoz of Suquamish,” he said out the window.
“Stay out of trouble.”
# Changing of the Guard
I knew Mom would not be happy with the arrangement, but I figured Freddy’s days were numbered, anyway, and since he spent most of his time in the house, we agreed to swap rooms.
I’m not saying the shed’s a palace, but I made a desk out of eight cinder blocks and a half sheet of splintered plywood, and lined my books in even rows along the workbench, until the place started looking homey, in a third-world way.
I hung up my Billy Bass and pushed it a few times. “Take Me to the River,” he sang, his big lips moving so lifelike, his tail fin wagging in rhythm.
The biggest improvement was the solitude. Besides the thrumming of Freddy’s bass, the relentless screech of my neighbor Dale’s band saw deep into the night, and the occasional bottle rocket or M-80, it was pretty quiet out there. The first night, I settled into my air mattress and read this old French geezer, Céline, and boy, was he pissed off at the state of the world. I had to admire his spirit.
In the morning, I walked into the house to eat a couple Eggos and make my lunch before work, and guess who walked out of my mom’s bedroom in his hopelessly stretched-out tighty-whities? I’ll give you a hint: it wasn’t Bernie Sanders.
I was more stunned than anything else. “Freddy? Uhhh?”
“Mornin’, Mike. How was the guest cottage?”
“Where’s my mom?”
“I’m right here, honey,” she said, walking out after him in her bathrobe.
“Oh,” I said.
And really, what else could I say?
After breakfast, while I was scraping my plate into the garbage under the sink, I happened guiltily upon Freddy’s recent handiwork. And I have to admit, his fix was pretty ingenious. He’d replaced both the cracked drainpipe and the leaking elbow with the Festiva’s radiator hose and clamps. Cost: zero. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little jealous that I’d never thought of it. That’s when I realized that there had been an official changing of the guard. My status as head of household had been usurped by a man who recorded homemade soundtracks to 1980s porn.
# Chief Seattle Days
I guess you get used to seeing things a certain way, so that even when they change you stop noticing. Maybe that’s why I haven’t exactly raved about the res. Sure, there’s a beautiful new tribal center where the slab used to be, but I still think of it as the slab, a hoopless basketball court riddled with potholes. They’ve dolled up Chief Seattle’s grave, but the place remains largely forgotten in spite of the new infrastructure the casino dollars have provided. They’ve rebuilt the dock, but it still leads to the same old place. I suppose it might help if I were Indian; maybe that would imbue the res with a sense of heritage, maybe then I’d feel some vital connection to the place. But as it is, it just feels like the place I’ve been stuck my whole life.
Except, that is, for a single weekend at the end of summer, when the whole res is transformed, and Suquamish feels like somewhere for once. For forty-eight hours, everyone puts their misery on hold. Old grudges are temporarily forgotten. The drumming and the dancing never cease. And the whole town is redolent with barbecue smoke. Some of my best childhood memories are of Chief Seattle Days. With the parade, the canoe races, the pageant, the salmon dinner, the softball tournament, and the vendors, it’s quite a powwow.
Mom had to work doubles all weekend, but somehow Freddy managed to get the days off. Saturday, around noon, Nate, Freddy, and I trudged downtown into the thick of the festivities. It was eighty degrees, and people who shouldn’t wear shorts were wearing shorts, including Freddy. I bought us all Indian tacos and lavender lemonades and bottle rockets, and we listened to the drums and watched the dancing and ate more Indian tacos. We poked around the booths and watched part of a softball game and ate sno-cones and shot off our rockets. Then we rounded it all off with a salmon dinner for nine bucks a plate—my treat.
In the evening, we bumped into Nick down by the tribal center. Considering we had not spoken since he walked out of Tequila’s a few weeks ago, it wasn’t that awkward. Familiarity trumps just about anything in the end. Why else would we keep making the same mistakes over and over?
Nick had a bottle of Old Crow in his pack, and I staked us to a box of Henry’s Private Reserve, and we all walked down to the beach. At the bottom of the stairs by the boat ramp slumped the snaggle-toothed Indian kid, looking disconsolate with his beat-up guitar case and an old gray wirehaired dog sprawled at his feet.
“Boy, can you play that ax?” said Freddy.
The kid shrugged. “Some.”
“Well, come on, then.”
The kid stood up and fell in line with us, the old dog following along at a distance of ten or twenty feet, nose to the ground. We walked north under the bluff, away from what was left of the revelers, spreading out to collect firewood along the beach. Nick and I were side by side out of habit.
“Dude, look, I’m sorry,” I said.
“For being a fag?”
“For being a jerk.”
He took a slug of the whiskey and passed it to me.
“Fair enough,” he said. “I’m a jerk, too, if you hadn’t noticed. But, dude, did you seriously put a guy’s dick in your mouth?”
I passed the bottle back. “I was in fourth grade.”
Nick immediately wiped the rim of the bottle off with his shirtsleeve.
“That’s it? That was the last one?”
“Does it matter?”
Nick took a slug and handed the bottle back, considering me in the dusky light, like he was looking for a different Mike.
“Fuck it,” he said. “I guess not. Just stop talking about it. So, you think our offensive line is going to be shit again?”
“Depends on how things shake out with the draft and everything.”
“Yeah, that’s what I’m afraid of. What the fuck makes anyone think Britt can play center? Couldn’t play guard, couldn’t play tackle, now he’s supposed to be the answer at center? Arizona scares me, bro. Fuck, I hate Arians. He looks so fucking stupid in that Kangol hat with his fucking red face. He reminds me of my dad.”
“I can see that.”
“Fuck that guy. I hope he drops dead.”
“Arians or your dad?”
“Both of them.”
We all converged about a quarter mile down beach, away from the fireworks, our arms loaded with driftwood. Coaxing logs around to serve as benches, we started a fire under the bluff and commenced drinking beer and passing around the Old Crow. Now and then, somebody patted the dog’s head as we bullshitted and ate pretzels, and sometimes fell to silently watching the fire, hypnotized by the hiss and crackle of it. At one point, the kid’s dog started vigorously lapping at its own nuts, and we couldn’t help but pay attention.
“Wish I could do that,” said Nick.
“Better pet him first,” I said.
We all laughed at that and stared back into the fire, sipping our beers as the water licked the shore.
“Boy, what’s your name?” Freddy said to the kid.
“Marlin.”
“Like Brando?”
“Like the fish.”
“Marlin, let’s hear you play that hammer.”
The kid looked into the fire and kicked some embers around with his old combat boots.
“Do I gotta?”
“Hell, yes,” said Freddy. “Beach fire got to have a guitar.”
Marlin reluctantly lifted the guitar out of the case. He set it in his lap and looked at the fret board for about fifteen seconds, as though it might finally reveal the answer to some mystery. Then, apprehensively, eyes still trained on the neck, he started picking “Seven Nation Army” on his E string.
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
I thought I heard a little improvement myself, a little more confidence, a little less clumsiness, but Freddy was wincing.
“Don’t you know any chords, boy?”
“I can play something else, if you want,” the kid said.
“Well, no wonder you ain’t got but fifty cents in your case. Boy, get over here and let me teach you some chops. Freddy’s known primarily for his bass licks, but he can find his way around a six-string.”
Marlin stood up and lugged his guitar over to Freddy’s side of the fire, where Freddy immediately started instructing him, first in the art of tuning, as Nate watched on absently in a food-induced stupor. I scooted a little nearer to Nick, to where our arms were grazing, and Nick shifted ever so slightly on the log, like it might have made him uncomfortable. Then, as Freddy strummed a few soft chords, I leaned in real close and whispered in Nick’s ear.
“Do you want to see my dick?”
“The fuck!”
Nick hauled off and punched me in the shoulder so that I tipped backward off the log, spilling my beer. I landed on my back, looking up at the stars, laughing my ass off. After a second, Nick started laughing, too, then gave me a hand and pulled me up. I dusted myself off and grabbed the whiskey from Nick and took a pull, then he grabbed it back and did the same, without wiping the rim of the bottle.
Marlin was holding the guitar now, trying to strum a chord, with Freddy’s encouragement.
“That’s it, boy, easy now. You ain’t angry at the strings.”
“Remember back in fifth grade,” Nick said to me, “when we used to break into the school cafeteria at night and steal ice cream?”
“And cold Canadian Jumbos.”
“Remember when Nate got stuck in the window?”
“How could I forget?”
“Man, we were lucky. Weren’t we?”
“What do you mean?”
“Just running free like that. Nobody stopping us from doing whatever we wanted. We had it made.”
“That’s one way to look at it, I guess.”
I couldn’t help but love Nick a little more right then, knowing what his childhood looked like. The thought of it made me a little sad.
Before we knew it, Marlin was jerkily strumming “Wild Thing” in bona fide chords. The kid was thrilled, bright eyed and smiling. Suddenly his sound was so much bigger.
Freddy was pretty happy with himself, too. Hell, we were all happy with ourselves just then. Even Nate, who kept silently crop-dusting us. I looked around at everybody’s face in the glow of the firelight, and I wondered why we didn’t do this every night. Here we lived in this beautiful place, and I’d never even thought of it as beautiful before. It’d always been ugly by association, I guess. Now I felt like I was seeing it for the first time. The lights twinkling across the bay, the stars winking above, the forest rearing up behind us on the bluff.
I was pretty drunk by that time and pretty goddamn grateful for the crumbs life had been dropping in my path lately, like maybe they were leading somewhere new, some destination I couldn’t see yet. I couldn’t help but count my blessings: my job with Chaz Unlimited Limited, my new digs in the guest cottage, the $217 still miraculously sitting in my checking account. And then there were Remy and all the great books waiting to be read on my workbench. And the dim but compelling possibility that I might one day write a book myself or do something else of distinction.
For now, I had this beach fire, the lapping of the surf, these people, this beer, this laughter. These pretzels, this music, this momentary sensation that in spite of all the unrest and injustice, and hatred and greed, in spite of the cold, uncaring stars wheeling above us, we live in the most beautiful of all possible worlds. And yes, the moments are fleeting, like my mom’s smile, and it’s not often we have control over them, and that just makes them all the sweeter. Fuck it, if that sounds like a Jack Johnson song, it’s true.
I started misting over in spite of myself, wiping my eyes as though the smoke were to blame, but my friends saw right through it. “What’s the matter, boy?” Freddy wanted to know.
Nick put a hand on my shoulder. “What up, bro?”
“Just happy,” I said. “That’s all.”
# How to Seize the Day
My high spirits lasted through Sunday, and Monday morning I awoke refreshed, ready to go out and seize the day. On the bus, I read Richard Brautigan, and anything seemed possible. After all the vitriol of Céline, I’d told my library friend, Andrew, I was looking for something gentler, and he steered me to Trout Fishing in America. Old Brautigan made heartbreak seem jaunty, and the world, for all its messed-up shit, seemed like a place with soft edges.
But when I showed up to work, there were three squad cars in front of the warehouse, and Austin and his roaster buddies were standing in front of the warehouse in their skinny jeans and ironic T-shirts, drinking macchiato and rubbernecking at the scene.
“What’s up?” I said.
“Pretty sure your boy Jazz is getting pinched,” said Austin.
“What the fuck?” I said.
No sooner did the words leave my mouth than two cops escorted Chaz out, hands cuffed behind his back. Always the optimist, Chaz was smiling like Bill Clinton in a sea of big red balloons.
“Chaz!” I called out.
He looked at me and shrugged like it was no big deal.
“A minor setback, Muñoz, trust me. Nothing to worry about. Stay the course, comrade. Stand by and think big, Muñoz.”
The cop gave Chaz a little shove and dug an elbow into his kidney as he guided him into the backseat.
“Keys are under the floor mat—driver’s side,” he said as he disappeared into the depths of the cruiser.
“What a loser,” said Austin.
“Fuck you,” I said.
Why the fuck I ever thought I could be friends with that guy, I have no idea. You just know a little punk like that has a safety net. Two parents somewhere with money. All I know is, whatever Chaz did, whatever crime he perpetrated to get busted (provided it wasn’t human trafficking or child pornography), he was nobler in my eyes than that little phony Austin. What did Austin ever do but eat expensive sandwiches, pet his beard, and act superior?
It was looking like I had the day off, along with the foreseeable future— as in, the cops put a chain on the door. Hopefully, they cleared out Thing One and Thing Two first, or they could still be in there, not talking and not going to the bathroom. After the roasters dispersed and the squad cars pulled away in a motorcade, I was stuck standing in the parking lot. All I could think about was my last paycheck that I’d never see. Fourteen hundred bucks.
Yes, old Mike Muñoz was screwed again. Suddenly, a tidal wave of buyer’s remorse crashed down on me. The fishing rod, the breakfast buffets, the Indian tacos, the bottle rockets, and salmon dinners— frivolous, all of it. Who did I think I was spending so thoughtlessly these past months? God, what an idiot I’d been. And now what? Two hundred seventeen bucks from destitution all over again. If only there was something I could do to get all that money back.
It took me a half hour to decide what I should do about Chaz’s BMW. Probably the smart thing would have been just to leave it parked where it was, but Chaz seemed to want me to do something with it, and Chaz had always been a stand-up guy with me, so I felt obliged. Also, I figured the car gave me my best chance of seeing that last paycheck.
I found the key under the mat, activated the blow-and-go, and drove the limit all the way home. I parked it in the driveway, behind the moldering Festiva, where the BMW didn’t take long to attract the attention of the whole neighborhood.
Don’t get the idea that I had any intention of driving that car around town like I owned it. Oh no. That car was staying right where I parked it until such time as Chaz came to claim it or provided me with further instructions.
# Standing By, Thinking Big
I stood by, just as Chaz told me to do. I tried to think big, I really did. I worked at it. I even wrote every afternoon for three hours and piled up eleven pages. They were terrible, but they were pages. As long as I didn’t go back and read them, I was making progress. I didn’t buy a single tallboy for at least a week. I went to bed early and sprawled on my air mattress in the shed, lulled by the screeching caterwaul of Dale’s band saw. I tried to imagine my current situation as the minor setback that Chaz assured me that it was. I tried to imagine bigger and better things for Mike Muñoz. A new job, a new truck, my own place, a real novel with my name on it. But the thing of it is, I don’t really know how to think big. God knows, nobody ever taught me. In fact, I was taught precisely the opposite. I was taught to always expect and prepare for something less, because eight times out of ten, that’s what was coming. To actually expect anything bigger or better was simply beyond my reach.
But just for the sake of argument, supposing I actually did manage to envision some ideal for myself—a Pulitzer Prize, a BMW, a drawer full of matching socks—how was I realistically going to make such a thing happen, given my current circumstances? Yes, there was hard work, to which I was no stranger, but what had my hard work ever achieved? Maybe Chaz was right. Maybe it’s smarter to take the path of least resistance. There was commitment, to which I was also no stranger, but what had my commitments ever done but shackle me to my threadbare reality? And like Chaz said, the more you committed to, the more you had at stake. That left luck and big risks, the very things that Chaz encouraged me to court. But when had Mike Muñoz ever been lucky?
By ten o’clock, I was biting my nails, tossing fitfully atop the air mattress. I turned on my lamp, and reached for my fourteen-dollar paperback, a “luminous debut” I’d recently picked off the new arrivals table at Liberty Bay Books, written by an MFA grad named Joshua. But it was no use. I couldn’t connect. The writing was overwrought, and the story was lagging. I just couldn’t concentrate. I kept reading the same sentence over and over. The protagonist was eating an apple and walking across a parking lot toward her mother’s car, “her thoughts gleaming with a smoky chiaroscuro of nostalgia.”
All I could think about was the money I’d blown the past few weeks; it had to be four hundred bucks—next month’s rent. Somehow I had to recoup that money.
I’d like to think that I am somewhat self-aware. I’ve got some blind spots, that’s obvious, but all in all, I feel like I’ve got a pretty clear view of reality. More often than not, I know when, and why, I’m making a bad decision. Most of us do—and by us, I mean broke people. Take smoking, for example. If Mom didn’t smoke away ten bucks a day, we never would’ve had to rent out the guest cottage to Freddy in the first place, right? Mom knows that, she’s done the math a million times. But there’s more to consider. For starters, she’s perpetually tired. She’s been working fifty-hour weeks for as long as I can remember. And there’s a good chance she’s clinically depressed. Smoking gets her through that second shift. It relaxes her when the pressure is mounting. It gives her something to look forward to during her break and after work, and before work, and when she wakes up in the morning. It makes her heart beat faster. At ten bucks a day, that’s a bargain.
Then there’s the casino. You won’t find Warren Buffett slumped at a onearmed bandit. Don’t expect to see the CEO of Verizon hooked to a rolling oxygen tank, cigarette dangling from his lip, pumping tokens into a slot machine like an act of faith. No, it’s usually us poor fucks. And yes, the very act of poor people gambling defies reason. Isn’t that the point? All the observable phenomena in our lives, all our personal experience, encourage us to keep our heads down and not expect any windfalls. Hell, not even a fair shake. Your boss won’t give you a break. The bank won’t give you a break. The landlord won’t give you a break. The politicians and the corporations sure won’t give you a break. Even the clerk at the Masi won’t give you a break. Why not give Lady Luck a shot? She’s no crueler or more fickle than any other master. At least you feel like you’ve got a ghost of a chance with her. You know what you’re up against. The rules aren’t always changing like everything else. Gambling fools us into thinking we’re somehow impervious to the odds, that the universe might grant us an exception.
But then, don’t dreams do the same thing?
So, yeah, on the surface, walking to the casino last night was probably not a wise decision, not for a guy with two hundred seventeen bucks to his name. It was a dry seventy degrees with a slight breeze, so the trees whispered all around me. There were hardly any cars on the road. The old Milky Way was spray-painted across the sky, and when I stopped on the gravel shoulder to look up at it, it didn’t seem hostile, just vast. It was almost a relief to see the casino squatting on the bluff, a garish display of throbbing light.
At first, I only withdrew sixty bucks from the ATM, so it’s not like I wasn’t showing some restraint. And I was up eighteen bucks by midnight, which is two salmon dinners, if you’re doing the math, so it’s not like I was losing. In fact, I was feeling downright impervious to the odds, convinced I could recoup all the money I’d blown if I just played it smart. I guess you could say I was thinking big when I staked myself to another sixty bucks and took to the blackjack tables.
I recognized the dealer by the little scar running down her cheek. She used to work at the Masi, an Indian lady about my mom’s age, and like my mom, she looked tired and worry-worn in her rumpled work uniform. She didn’t seem to recognize me, or maybe she was trained not to be too familiar with patrons. Not that she wasn’t friendly. Even when I was up thirty-eight bucks, there seemed to be pity in her eyes. Her name tag said GEORGIA. Sweet Georgia, with the little pink scar on her cheek and the pity in her eyes. She was my lucky charm for the next hour and a half.
Before long, I was up eighty bucks. Then a hundred four. Then one twenty-six. Then one seventy! No, not life-changing money, not even enough to impress anyone at the table, but with every chip I collected, something was redeemed—a fishing pole, a DVD, a singing bass. And sweet Georgia was my redeemer, my dealer of good fortune. It was like she wanted me to win. If I ever found a stray cat or managed to buy another truck, I vowed to name it Georgia.
I was up two twenty-five when Georgia’s shift ended. That’s when the guy next to me, who was down big, cut his losses and called it quits. I probably should’ve done the same, but I was thinking big. I asked myself
WWCD, as in, What would Chaz do? And I knew without a shadow of a doubt, Chaz would keep laying down his chips.
The new dealer was fresh. Clean and pressed, like he just woke up and took a shower and shampooed his beard. His name tag said PHILLIP. He had a sharp nose and a wolfish grin, and unlike Georgia, there was no pity in his small eyes. The first hand he dealt me was an eight up and an eight down, then he hit me with a queen. The next three hands looked about the same. Before I knew it, I found myself back at the ATM for sixty more bucks and paying another three-dollar surcharge, determined to win my money back.
Well, you can guess how it all ended, kiddos. Old Mike Muñoz shit the money bed. Yep, I lost everything—and mostly on decent hands, too. I don’t blame Phillip, but if I ever find out which car is his, I’ll slash his goddamn tires anyway.
“The casino offers a free door-to-door shuttle,” he offered, sweeping up the last of my chips. “Blow me,” I said.
I left the casino on foot. With fifty-eight cents in my pocket, and twentyeight dollars left in my checking account, I began the long, dark walk home. The stars were still out, and once I got away from the highway, I found a little peace. Things were only slightly worse than when the night began. What was two hundred bucks in the big picture? Nothing like the breadth of the night sky to make your worldly troubles seem insignificant.
# Miguel Is El Mejor
After leaving the casino, I was about a mile down Suquamish Way when headlights washed over me, and a beat-up pickup slowed to a crawl as it passed. The driver promptly hit the brakes and swerved to the shoulder, stopping altogether. The way my luck was running, it gave me the creeps.
The pickup sat idling hoarsely on the dirt shoulder for a few seconds as I froze in place, aglow in the red taillights, spooked by the prospect of getting brutalized and left in a ditch. I don’t know why, but I felt a little better once the passenger’s door opened, and salsa music spilled out of the cab.
“¿Queeeé ooooonda, eseeee?”
It was my old compatriot Tino, obviously drunk.
“Hop in, vato!”
Approaching the truck, I deduced in the glow of the brake lights that there were already three bodies in the cab.
“What, you mean in back?”
“Naw, man. ¡Muévate, puto!” he said, shoving the guy next to him. All three of them squished over, even the driver. Still, there were only about six inches to fit my ass on, and I could barely close the door. “Rocindo,” Tino said. “This is Miguel, the one I told you about.” “Hey,” I said.
“Where you going, man?” said Tino. “Where’s your truck?” “At home,” I said.
“You mean at your mom’s house?”
“It’s both our house.”
“Sí,” said Tino. “Su casa es la casa de tu madre.” The others laughed.
“Fuck you, puto,” I said just as Rocindo pulled back onto the pavement and started heading toward town.
“You wanna go to a party in Kingston, vato?” Tino said. “Nah, man. Just drop me off.”
“C’mon, ese. We have a good time.”
I could tell he was sincere, and I would’ve gone. God knows, I could’ve used a party. Anything to forget the financial bloodletting at the casino, my unemployment, my miserable prospects, and the rest of it. I truly had nothing to lose by going with Tino. But somehow I just couldn’t let him see how bad things had gotten. I guess somewhere in me, I still needed to feel superior to him.
“Sorry, man, I’m wiped. Got a bunch of stuff on my plate tomorrow.”
“No problem, Miguel. We drop you off.”
The whole drive to my house, I tried to talk myself into going with them. How could my night possibly get worse?
“Hey, Holmes,” said Tino. “The old lady misses you. Same with Truman. His boxwood look like shit, ese. It look like a fucking dog pruned it. Lacy was stupid to fire you.”
“Yeah, well.”
“He got to find a better lawn man, too.”
Ramiro promptly punched Tino in the shoulder.
“Shit, is true, mi primo, your edges suck!”
The little guy socked him again, and Tino just laughed.
“Sorry, but you ain’t Miguel, mi primo. Miguel is el mejor. It means, you the best, vato. You a pro.”
I can’t say I didn’t appreciate Tino saying so, just not enough to change my mind about going with them. It wasn’t until Rocindo pulled up in front of the house that I remembered Tino would likely be looking for my truck.
“Shit, ese, whose Bimmer?”
“Uh, yeah, that’s my boss’s car.”
“Nice,” he said. “Where you working, vato?”
“All over. This and that. Production, import, export, that kind of thing.
Anyway, thanks for the lift.”
Rocindo tipped his cowboy hat, and Ramiro smiled.
Tino still had questions, though, I could tell.
“Well, gotta go,” I said, climbing out. “You guys have fun.”
“Gimme a call, ese. You still got my number?” “Sí,” I said.
# When You Make Other Plans
When the day arrived to finally take Remy out, I was down to twenty bucks, which equated to two movie tickets—no Milk Duds, no popcorn. I thought about hitting up Freddy for a loan, but desperate as I was, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. I considered calling Remy and telling her I was down with the flu. But I decided I was done lying to her. If I had any hope of ever being with Remy, she’d have to accept me for what I was— broke.
So I bought a seven-dollar bottle of wine from Albertsons, along with some lunch meat, some bread, some cheese, and a couple of nonorganic Honeycrisp apples. I made sandwiches and cut them up into dainty squares, and sliced up the apples, and brought two mugs and some napkins and a bottle opener from home. I packed it all in the closest thing I could find to a picnic basket: the green tackle box I’d bought at the flea market. I rolled up a blanket, some newspaper, and some kindling and stuffed it in my old backpack from high school.
Remy was already waiting in front of the tribal visitor center when I arrived at five thirty. Her hair was different, but I couldn’t tell you how exactly. It might have been the light, but she seemed to be wearing more makeup than usual. She had a little wart under her eye, which I’d never noticed before, and a skin tag on her arm that looked like a toasted Rice Krispie.
“What a great idea, a picnic,” she said, clutching my arm. “I had no idea you were such a romantic.”
I was terrified almost to the point of nausea as we walked down the steps and crossed under the pier heading north, toward the same spot where, a few weeks earlier, I’d seen Suquamish as never before. I was hoping to recapture some of the romance of that night. The gentle lapping of the surf, the crackle of the fire, the crying of the gulls, riding on the briny air. This is what I imagined for Remy and me as we nibbled our sandwich squares and sipped our wine and made easy conversation.
But conditions were different this time around. To begin with, it was pretty windy, and the tide was way out, and something stank, like maybe a dead sea lion had washed up on the beach somewhere nearby. Also, it was threatening to rain. And not only were the sand fleas infuriating, but I also couldn’t get a decent fire going to save my life.
We ate the sandwiches, anyway, and made quick work of the wine. Remy did most of the talking while I blew on the fledgling fire. She told me about her two weeks in Wenatchee, and seeing her old friends and being glad that she’d moved on instead of getting stuck in Wenatchee, which didn’t sound so bad to me. There was a river and a brewery and mountains that were green in the spring and snow covered in winter.
Lousy fire and sand fleas aside, things were going pretty smoothly until it started to piss rain. We tried to pretend we didn’t notice for a few minutes, but eventually the smoke from the smoldering fire became unbearable.
Now what? Totally broke and no more wine. I definitely didn’t want to invite Remy to my house. What could be more unromantic than watching TV with Freddy and Nate? I scrambled for a solution as we made our way south toward the pier. The shed was beginning to look inevitable until Remy arrived at another prospect, equally as mortifying.
“Let’s duck into that bar,” she said, indicating the Tide’s Inn.
“You don’t want to go there,” I said. “Trust me.”
“It’s a bar,” she said. “It’s dry.”
“Yeah, but . . .”
“But what? Come on, I’m buying.”
I’m not ashamed that my mom is a waitress. It’s just not something I like to watch. For this very reason, I rarely go to the Tide’s Inn, though it’s only five blocks from the house and I could probably score an occasional free beer. Add to that the discomfort of bringing Remy to my mom’s place of employment, where somebody was bound to tease me, and you’ve got a pretty good idea why I was so itchy under the collar.
There were numerous BMX bikes parked out front, which is a hallmark on the res, because DUIs are kind of a thing around here. There was also an old St. Bernard with a giant tumor on his neck, lounging in the doorway. Stepping over the dog, we pushed through the door and made our way across a floor littered with scratch tickets, ending up at a wobbly table in back, where we sat in the glow of the ancient cigarette machine. “Uh, just so you know,” I said, “my mom is gonna be our waitress.”
“That’s your mom? Wow, she’s pretty.”
Mom was pleasantly surprised to see me, and I imagine even more surprised to see me with a girl.
“Ma, this is Remy.”
“Nice to meet you, sweetie. You have excellent taste in men.” My scalp tightened.
“Yeah, so far he’s a keeper,” said Remy.
Goddamn, it was hot in there. My mom hovered over our table, smalltalking with Remy for what seemed like an eternity. Honestly, I just wanted to get past the pretense and kiss Remy and find out whether or not it would be life changing.
My mom comped us a pitcher, which I knew would later come out of her tips.
“So when’s your novel going to be published?” Remy asked, topping off our glasses with the pitcher. “When can I read it?”
“Actually, uh, there is no novel,” I said. “Not really. I was just trying to impress you.”
“Ah, I see,” she said, visibly unimpressed. “So you lied?”
“It wasn’t a total lie,” I said. “I’m trying to write a novel, but it’s terrible. I wrote a scene where a guy is sitting on the toilet eating a turkey leg,
trying to figure out what he’s doing with his life.” “Is he pooping?” she asked.
“I haven’t really figured that out. I guess I assumed he was pooping, since his underwear is around his ankles.”
“He should be pooping,” she said. “Or he should get off the pot.” It was like she was talking about me.
When our beers were empty, we reached that awkward point where it was time to make a decision. I can’t speak for Remy, but I had a pretty good buzz by then, between the wine and the beer. My instinct was to drink more, because I felt like it would only get us closer to something definitive, but I didn’t have any money.
“Well, I better call it quits while I can still drive,” she said.
I should’ve said something like “You can always take a cab” or “You can crash on my couch” and then ordered another pitcher or a couple of Jägerbombs and had my mom comp it. But then, maybe Remy was trying to preserve something. Maybe she really did think I was a keeper. Maybe she didn’t want to move too fast.
Outside, the rain had let up. We stood in the parking lot for a while, prolonging the opportunity to take some elusive next step. I was compelled to take that step but mostly by voices in my head.
Nick: “Hit that shit.”
Freddy: “What you waitin’ for, boy?”
Mom: “She was awfully nice, Michael.”
What was the big hurry, anyway? If Remy and I were meant to be, it would happen, one way or another.
“We should do this again,” Remy said. “Totally. I’ll text you.” “Well . . .” she said.
I leaned into her, then stopped, then she leaned forward and halted. Finally, we leaned in at the same time and managed a kiss. It was clearly more than polite but still a little ambiguous. I should’ve put my hand on the small of her back and pulled her close to me and really locked lips with her, like in an old movie. I should have staked some claim to her immediate future.
“Thanks for the picnic,” she said, climbing into her car.
“You bet,” I said.
And then she drove off.
# The Revolution Is Postponed
That night, I dreamed of landscaping, of clean lines and neatly raked beds. Of calloused hands and green boot tops, of steaming mulch and hissing sprinklers and sun-dappled rhodies in full bloom. I dreamed of tidy edges and shady corners and weedless gravel paths meandering between rose beds. I dreamed of a world where I was still getting a paycheck, still coming home each day exhausted but satisfied, ninety-six dollars richer. In my dream, I had a brand-new F-250 named Georgia. And it was divine.
I awoke to the dulcet strains of Dale’s band saw, the rain beating down on the roof of the shed like pea gravel. The entire right side of my jaw was throbbing. The pain hit like a rubber mallet and ran like a shiver up the back of my skull. I reached in and wiggled the tooth with a wince until it was loose, and the pain took my breath away.
Believe me, it would have been easy to eat four Advils and stay in bed all day. But I got dressed and left without eating breakfast or even going in the house. By afternoon, with my loose tooth still throbbing ceaselessly, I put in job applications at KFC, Payless ShoeSource, and Taco del Mar.
On the bus ride back, wincing through my toothache, I read a half chapter of Knut Hamsun’s Hunger, and I’ll be honest, ravenous as I was, I didn’t really buy the conceit of the whole thing. First of all, the hungry people I knew weren’t bandying on about philosophy all the time. They talked about cheeseburgers, if anything. Also, they tended to look for jobs instead of wandering around refusing help. The guy in the book was basically kind of a pretentious bum.
Anyway, the bus broke down at 305 and Hostmark, right where some kind of protest was going on with a dozen or so picketers. So I watched it out the rain-streaked window while waiting for a new bus to arrive. The picketers’ homemade signs were running and bleeding so badly from the rain, you could hardly read them, and they were all wearing those cheap ponchos, the thin kind they give away at sporting events. Nobody, it seemed, was paying attention to the protesters or their cause, which was presumably why they were there in the first place.
After a moment, I recognized the ringleader as Andrew the librarian, he of the big Adam’s apple and the messed-up grill. He was the least miserable looking of the crusaders. In fact, there was something heroic about the way he was waving his sign defiantly, like a challenge, as though the weather were just one more oppressive force thwarting his cause, a cause I was still unable to ascertain, since his picket sign looked like a fucking Rorschach test. But I’d be a liar if I said the protest wasn’t sort of inspiring, whatever it was about. And I’d be lying if I said I didn’t wish, if only for a moment, that I could be like Andrew, waving that sign as though he believed he could deter the ruinous forces of greed and global warming, as if he believed he could actually save the world with it.
I confess, I’m one of those people who complains about the world and doesn’t do shit about it, aside from a little recycling, and only when it’s convenient. Sometimes it’s pretty hard to see past your immediate struggles, you know? But for a minute there, watching those miserable protesters, I felt the stirrings of a social conscience. How the hell else was anything going to change if people weren’t willing to take to the street and air their grievances?
But just look at me, what could I do, especially in this rain, with this debilitating toothache? And shouldn’t I be saving myself first, anyway? Wasn’t it kind of like the oxygen masks on airplanes? Wouldn’t I be more help to everybody else if I could breathe myself? Still, it got me to thinking that I could probably be doing more to make the world a better place. But first, old Mike Muñoz had to save himself, and that meant making some money—someway, somehow.
